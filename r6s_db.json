Hobbies that began in her youth, like interests in K-Metal and charcoal drawing, remain into her 30s \u2014 a testament to Choi\u2019s consistency and loyalty. Choi joined the Republic of Korea Armed Forces (ROKA) the moment she came of age, and began earning commendations, working swiftly up the ranks to Sergeant First Class (Sang-sa). She was soon recruited by the 35th Commando Battalion (Tarantula) where, in a tight-knit all-female unit, she mastered building clearance, hostage rescue, VIP protection, and the use of advanced technology when assaulting an enemy. The Tarantula Unit is a high-performing CTU that deserves its renown, and Choi\u2019s status as a standout about its specialists is notable, as she took the lead on a myriad of combat and intelligence operations. As other members retreated to the private sphere, she stayed, often the eldest in her unit. Performance reviews mention her thriving in this senior role, describing a fiercely protective soldier, who stops at nothing to keep her peers safe. PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORT Given the sparse intel we were able to collect from Specialist Bo-Ram \u201cRam\u201d Choi\u2019s past with the Tarantula Unit, I needed to see her in action to determine whether she could fit the bill. What happened at Tower was tragic and something we can't allow to happen again, but if we can extract a single positive from that day, it's Ram joining Redhammer. Her unblinking resilience in the face of extreme duress makes her a perfect fit. Ram explained to me how women in the Korean military can only enter at a very high rank, then laughed and said she expects the same treatment in Redhammer. While we only have one Captain, she exudes leadership. A big sister vibe, really. Been awhile since I had one of those, so I\u2019m not hating it. She\u2019s dialed in on the field to a very high degree. I envy her focus, whether it\u2019s during a mission or in downtime when she\u2019s got her headphones in and sketching charcoal. In our line of work there\u2019s a lot of, shall we say, \u201cforced redundancy,\u201d and if the axe falls on me one day, it\u2019ll be good to know I\u2019ve got a ready, willing and 100% capable replacement in Ram. -- Captain Jordan \u201cThermite\u201d Trace, Redhammer Squad Leader"}, "2": {"Side": "Attacker", "Name": "brava", "Squad": "Viperstrike", "Specialties": "ANTI-GADGET", "HEALTH": 1, "Speed": 3, "Gadget": "Smoke Grenade, Claymore", "primary_weapon": "PARA-308, ASSAULT RIFLE, CAMRS, Marksman Rifle", "secondary_weapon": "USP40, HANDGUN, Super Shorty, SHOTGUN", "ability": "Kludge Drone", "RealName": "Nayara Cardoso", "DateofBirth": "January 10th (40)", "PlaceofBirth": "Curitiba, Brazil", "Biography": "BIOGRAPHY \u201cSometimes the only path to justice is through a bullet\u2026\u201d Brava\u2019s childhood was impacted by the untimely death of her cousin, an innocent bystander in a heist gone wrong. The criminal involvement in the event motivated Cardoso to pursue a degree in law. Her inability to effect significant change within the system as a criminal prosecutor left her disillusioned and prompted her to join the Departamento de Pol\u00edcia Federal (DPF). As an Agent de Pol\u00edcia Federal, Cardoso combated interstate and federal crime, eventually becoming a Federal Police Commissioner. She commanded investigations, issued warrants, and following a special recommendation from the DPF, moved to Brasilia to apply to the Comando de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es T\u00e1ticas (COT). After completing the 18-week course of air, amphibious, and riverside operations training, Cardoso joined the COT\u2019s high-risk interventions unit. Brava\u2019s specialization in resolving civil aircraft hijackings brought her to the attention of Captain Yumiko \u201cHibana\u201d Imagawa, but it\u2019s her stellar performance record that earned her a place in Viperstrike. PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORT The formal record indicates my reasons for recruiting Specialist Nayara \u201cBrava\u201d Cardoso are tied to her \u201cstellar performance record.\u201d Allow me to be elaborate as to why Brava is a natural fit for the foremost CTU in the world, Viperstrike. During Operation Crushed Rock, she single-handedly turned an impossible situation into a victory. The official purpose of the mission, rescuing hostages that included her cousin Specialist Vicente \u201cCapit\u00e3o\u201d Souza, was optimistic to say the least. It was well known that the criminal organization holding him never let anyone go alive, and that if Capit\u00e3o was still breathing in the first place it was because they believed he could be broken. Despite the COT\u2019s faultless preparation, the long odds saw their tactical execution fall apart. With no other recourse, Brava became judge, jury, and executioner on that mission, and was the only reason Souza made it out with his life. If any one of the dozens of criminals holding Capit\u00e3o had survived, I\u2019m sure their nightmares would be haunted by images of Brava storming their compound. Her performance on that day is what legends are made of, and legends belong in Viperstrike. Brava knows the cost of pulling the trigger like few others do. Yet throughout it all she remains an idealist, which make missions like Operation [REDACTED] exact a hard toll on her. There is an old saying in Ky\u016bd\u014d, \u201cShooting with technique improves the shooting, but shooting with spirit improves the person.\u201d Brava does all the personal and professional work required to transcend her personal preferences and be decisive in the field. The squad will benefit from someone that shoots with spirit. It will be important to keep an eye on her relationship with Capit\u00e3o. He seems to want to bond with her, but she shuts him out. When I asked about it, she told me that \u201cpersonal relationships are distracting,\u201d but that hasn\u2019t stopped Brava from developing a friendship with J\u00e4ger over their shared enthusiasm for aircraft. I will let it lie so long as it doesn\u2019t bleed into our operation performance. -- Captain Yumiko \u201cHibana\u201d Imagawa, Viperstrike Squad Leader"}, "3": {"Side": "Attacker", "Name": "grim", "Squad": "Nighthaven", "Specialties": "Line,MAP CONTROL", "HEALTH": 1, "Speed": 3, "Gadget": "Breach Charge, Claymore", "primary_weapon": "552 Commando, ASSAULT RIFLE, SG-CQB, SHOTGUN", "secondary_weapon": "P229, HANDGUN", "ability": "Kawan Hive Launcher", "RealName": "Charlie Tho Keng Boon", "DateofBirth": "April 5th (Age 39)", "PlaceofBirth": "Jurong, Singapore", "Biography": "Biography \u201cGet out of my way.\u201d Growing up in Jurong, Singapore, Keng Boon could often be found in the wilderness learning and practicing the skills he was taught by his survivalist father.

Within minutes of our initial meeting, I had the sense he was conducting his own evaluation. There is a coldness to him that makes me wonder what would have occurred had I not met his qualifications. Even as a child Keng Boon displayed a predatory disposition. When he talked about afternoons spent helping his mother tend her beehives, he referred to an incident worth exploring. One of those afternoons was interrupted by an armed assailant. Using a strategy he observed in bees, Keng Boon took down the man, who was twice his size, by focusing on the sensitive areas around the head. His aggression was so precise and overwhelming that his mother\u2019s attacker never recovered from the resulting coma. When I asked if this event affects him today, Keng Boon answered \u201cNo.\u201d Whether guilt regarding the event was dismissed or present at all is undetermined. Despite his lack of sociability, he demonstrates no discomfort working within a combat unit. In [REDACTED], Commander [REDACTED] states \u201cKeng Boon\u2019s ruthlessness is an asset to [REDACTED]. The [REDACTED] casualties resulting from [REDACTED] were justifiable risks with no unsanctioned kills.

Ngoma also learned the basics of mechanics in their father\u2019s garage, effectively rounding out the skillset that they would later apply in their career. They excelled in tactical training and military sciences, going on to become a combat engineer. Bright and imaginative, Ngoma proved invaluable in every task they tackled. They would support their comrades with strategies and technologies to divert enemies\u2019 attention and break down hostile defenses. Their specialization in such tactics, which had the reputation of minimizing casualties on all sides without compromising objectives, earned Ngoma several service medals. They eventually caught the attention of the Belgian Special Forces Group, under which they have served ever since. Psychological report Assessing Specialist N\u00e9on \u201cSens\u201d Ngoma was difficult at times. They have a habit of diverting the conversation to theories of psychology, rather than how it applies to them. Still, I was able to get the information I was looking for in the moments in-between. When speaking of their understanding of human behavior, they often bring up childhood memories of people-watching and solving puzzles. Much like a puzzle cube needs to be aligned in a precise sequence, Ngoma predicts how people will react with the right push. [\u2026] When asked about their upbringing, they only have good things to say about their family. Their parents, one Belgian and the other Congolese, were happy to support all three siblings in their (quite different) career choices. Ngoma recalls that when they and their youngest sibling came out, their father insisted that the only thing he expected of his children was honesty. Whatever difficulties they might have encountered between then and now have done nothing to quell their spirit. Being warm and open is, as Ngoma says, not just a great way to make friends, but also their way of spiting those who try to get in their way. It seems to be working out well for them so far. [\u2026] As I often try to do these days, I inquired about Ngoma\u2019s hobbies, and I was surprised to learn that music has a big place in their life. They praised it as the universal language of love. They connect to the world by listening to artists from all over, to their father\u2019s heritage with songs from his home, and to their youngest sibling by playing her EDM sets at every opportunity.

She began her schooling there and learned the family trade of toymaking, all the while developing a near obsession for 60s science-fiction films. She followed her passion for creation and technology and studied electromechanics at a vocational school, and then military engineering at the University of Zagreb where she excelled at robotics engineering. She found herself isolated due to her unorthodox approach and others\u2019 attitudes towards her transition, so she focused on her work. Her unique perspective and raw creative ability set her apart from her peers and got her the attention of Kali, who was in the country looking for recruits. An offer followed, and Jankovi\u0107 joined Nighthaven. The company\u2019s success can be largely credited to Osa\u2019s inventions and her field work. Her efficiency and the versatility of her arsenal have given them an edge in every recorded operation, and by proving herself to be a dedicated and reliable asset she earned the choice position of Nighthaven\u2019s head of R&D. Psychological report Specialist Anja \u201cOsa\u201d Jankovi\u0107 didn\u2019t shy away from letting me know that speaking to me about personal matters was a professional courtesy; she always has work to get back to, and time with me is more of a distraction than anything else. [\u2026] In all matters, she is grounded by the meticulous precision that her aunt taught her yet driven by a sense of wonder. She attributes this to her favorite childhood movie, Empress of the Plutomatons (1967). As I understand, it was filled with futuristic technology and colorful imagery, and was ahead of its time in the presentation of a strong female protagonist. It\u2019s easy to see the trajectory between that little girl, wonderstruck by robots and spaceships, and the genius that she is today. Her creations are more than their function, to her at least. She walked me through the process of developing Wamai\u2019s Mag-NET Systems, from idea to working prototype. Before she even thinks about materials and calculates the physics of a device, she draws it out with a specific aesthetic and color palette in mind. Aruni\u2019s prosthetics, Kali\u2019s Masterframe outfit, Ace\u2019s Breachers\u2026 they\u2019re more than just equipment, they\u2019re art pieces.

I was surprised to learn of his early ambition to become a pediatric surgeon \u2013 a role he seems to regard as the pinnacle of social standing.

[\u2026] Her face lights up when she tells the story of watching the landing on Titan with her mom, or of her precious few days on the International Space Station. It\u2019s clear these events triggered a growing impatience to go further and see more. Had she been born 200 years earlier, she would have been one of the intrepid souls mapping every corner of our tiny blue marble, but as it is she\u2019s had to settle for distant and less familiar worlds. [\u2026] Reading Meijer\u2019s file, it\u2019s apparent that she succeeds through sheer intellect, resolve, and fearlessness. Yet cocooned within her collaborative and outgoing exterior is a fragile core she keeps guarded and private. Growing up albino wasn\u2019t an easy proposition, regardless of how outwardly tolerant society may seem. There was social stigma and childish name-calling, but these hardships fostered self-determination and self-assurance. Alone, she is a like a raging river: Hell-bent on overcoming any obstacle that blocks her way, regardless of the personal cost. [\u2026] She was eager to share her experiences and knowledge, and to grow within a very different sort of team than is her natural habitat. Especially thrilling is her ability to analyze a myriad of scenarios and to create discreet aspects of herself to tackle each of them simultaneously. Often, those who multitask have reduced outcomes in all areas, but here, also, Meijer is the exception. [\u2026] I have every confidence that she will make an excellent addition to Rainbow. However, much like Specialists Eliza \u201cAsh\u201d Cohen and Elena \u201cMira\u201d \u00c1lvarez, it will be paramount to ensure that she synergizes with her team, rather than struggling alone to cross-purposes. -- Dr. Harishva \"Harry\" Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}, "10": {"Side": "Attacker", "Name": "kali", "Squad": "Nighthaven", "Specialties": "ADGET,SUPPORT", "HEALTH": 2, "Speed": 2, "Difficulty": 2, "Gadget": "Breach Charge, Claymore", "primary_weapon": "CSRX 300, Marksman Rifle", "secondary_weapon": "SPSMG9, Machine Pistol, C75 Auto, Machine Pistol", "ability": "LV Explosive Lance", "RealName": "Jaimini Kalimohan Shah", "DateofBirth": "August 21st (34)", "PlaceofBirth": "Amreli, India", "Biography": "Biography \u201cAcceptance of mediocrity is the first step toward failure.\u201d Born to wealthy parents, Shah\u2019s ability to achieve her goals was assured from an early age. This self-assurance hit a brick wall when she tried to join the military. Her interest in martial arts led her to enlist, but she quickly discovered that women weren\u2019t allowed to serve in combat units. Despite all of her money and all of her social influence, she had found an obstacle between her and something she wanted, and it would not budge. Leaving the military, she created her own Private Security Company to operate within India\u2019s borders, then a Private Military Company, NIGHTHAVEN, to operate overseas. She routinely negotiates multi-million-dollar contracts with incredibly favorable terms. Her ruthlessness is legendary, but by becoming a resource the Indian government desperately needs she has circumvented the laws that kept her from her goal and revalidated her self-perception as an unstoppable force in a largely static world. Psychological report Cultural similarity isn\u2019t always a benefit when undertaking psychoanalysis. [\u2026] Despite our shared heritage, Specialist Jaimini Kalimohan \u201cKali\u201d Shah\u2019s experiences are as alien to me as if she had come from the dark side of the moon. Contrary to what the romantics of this world would have you believe, money does create a boundary that can\u2019t be crossed by any other means. [\u2026] As a child, Shah received everything she wanted, without effort or attention. She is both ambitious and arrogant, but not without merit. She excels as a leader, primarily by driving those under her command beyond their psychological and physical breaking points to \u201cforge them anew.\u201d The fact that those who complete her training are then inducted into an inner circle \u2013 a society of protectors, as she\u2019s apt to call it \u2013 does little to separate her from notorious criminal overlords. And yet if I am consistent in believing that everyone has something to teach, I can\u2019t discount her methods. [\u2026] Does Shah have any sense of nationalistic pride? It\u2019s difficult to say. To the ultra-rich, borders are merely suggestions. Yet her assumption of the name Kali and her ruthlessness toward those who cross her both imply a connection with the country of her ancestors. [\u2026] I suspect this lack of clarity with regards to her motivations is what has already put her at odds with Specialist Eliza \u201cAsh\u201d Cohen, but that was to be expected. Cohen is someone who lives by a very strict set of rules, and Shah\u2019s very existence calls many of Cohen\u2019s beliefs into question. [\u2026] As for her strengths, they are many. She didn\u2019t get to where she is by cruising on her family\u2019s success. Her training regimen is relentless, augmented by the best trainers and the best equipment money can buy. She is brave \u2013 some would say foolhardy \u2013 and she is cunning. Put simply, she\u2019s someone I would be loath to face off against, so it seemed prudent to invite her to join Rainbow. Friends and enemies being what they are, we may have need of her particular strategies far sooner than we would like to admit. -- Dr. Harishva \"Harry\" Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}, "11": {"Side": "Attacker", "Name": "amaru", "Squad": "Redhammer", "Specialties": "Line,MAP CONTROL", "HEALTH": 2, "Speed": 2, "Difficulty": 2, "Gadget": "Stun Grenade, HARD BREACH CHARGE", "primary_weapon": "G8A1, Light Machine Gun, SuperNova, SHOTGUN", "secondary_weapon": "Gonne-6, Hand Cannon, SMG-11, Machine Pistol", "ability": "Garra Hook", "RealName": "Azucena Roc\u00edo Quispe", "DateofBirth": "May 6th (Age 48)", "PlaceofBirth": "Cojata, Peru", "Biography": "Biography \u201cForget who you are, and nothing else matters. You\u2019ll fight for anyone, and never know why.\u201d Specialist Azucena Roc\u00edo \u201cAmaru\u201d Quispe began her career as an anthropologist concerned with the preservation of Peru\u2019s shared cultural heritage. Her unique familial link to colonial explorers of the early 20th century gave her uncommon insight into both how voyages of discovery can shape cultural consciousness, and into the deep and abiding loss created when a shared cultural touchstone is lost. She served for several years in the Polic\u00eda Nacional del Per\u00fa (PNP), before reorienting as a freelance archeologist focussed on the discovery and categorisation of new archaeological sites. After several run-ins with antiquities traffickers, and failed attempts to bring them down from within, she turned to guerrilla tactics in order to seize important cultural discoveries for the Peruvian State. When Specialist C\u00e9sar \u201cGoyo\u201d Ruiz Hern\u00e1ndez made us aware of her presence, she had already spent some 20-odd years in the jungles of Peru, fighting the cartels on her own terms. Psychological report Specialist Azucena Roc\u00edo \u201cAmaru\u201d Quispe\u2019s self-awareness is uncanny, especially with regards to what motivates her. Loss is not unusual for an operator to face, but not often in such great numbers, nor in such quick succession. [\u2026] She learned early on to be at home in the jungle. Her family attachments were the grounding elements in a difficult childhood. While her siblings and cousins provided her with plenty of friendly rivalries, her grandmother\u2019s quiet hope is what she speaks of most fondly. From what I understand, her great-grandfather disappeared almost a century ago on an expedition to a lost city \u2013 details suggest he traveled with Percy Fawcett, though confirmation is impossible \u2013 yet Quispe\u2019s grandmother always believed her father would return. Even long after Kantuta\u2019s death, I suspect Quispe still holds the same fairytale notion of an eventual reunion. [\u2026] Quispe\u2019s strength lies in her uncommon mix of realism and good humor. She isn\u2019t afraid to laugh at the curveballs life throws her, yet she has confessed to me that she feels \u201chaunted\u201d by the ongoing unrest in her home country. She is, first and foremost, possessed of a deep and abiding love for Peru. [\u2026] I would never accuse Quispe of being a sentimentalist, because her interest in preserving her culture is far more mercenary than most people would understand. [\u2026] The bond between Quispe and Specialist C\u00e9sar \u201cGoyo\u201d Ruiz Hern\u00e1ndez is clearly something they both treasure. I suspect she accepted the offer to join Rainbow simply to spend time with him, believing that she would be back in the Amazon before too long. What she seeks is more tools to add to her arsenal, but it\u2019s what she has to teach that\u2019s vital to the future of this unit. Without her, we will be hard-pressed to combat the very forces she has been evading for the past 20 years. [\u2026] In any case, her gregariousness has seen her quickly integrated with the other operators. It remains now only to convince her that this is where she can make the greatest difference, and that task falls to me. -- Dr. Harishva \"Harry\" Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}, "12": {"Side": "Attacker", "Name": "nokk", "Squad": "Ghosteyes", "Specialties": "Line,MAP CONTROL", "HEALTH": 2, "Speed": 2, "Difficulty": 3, "Gadget": "HARD BREACH CHARGE, Frag Grenade", "primary_weapon": "FMG-9, SUBMACHINE GUN, SIX12 SD, SHOTGUN", "secondary_weapon": "5.7 USG, HANDGUN, D-50, HANDGUN", "ability": "HEL Presence Reduction", "RealName": "[REDACTED]", "DateofBirth": "[REDACTED]", "PlaceofBirth": "[REDACTED]", "Biography": "Biography \u201cThe only thing I feel when I pull the trigger is recoil.\u201d For reasons of National Security and currently active missions, N\u00f8kk\u2019s records are sealed at NATO Confidential security clearance, but her files have been released to Six. N\u00f8kk enlisted at the Army NCO School in S\u00f8nderborg, then enrolled at the Royal Danish Military Academy where she graduated at the rank of First Lieutenant. With four deployments under her belt, N\u00f8kk underwent additional special operations training, earning her J\u00e6gerkorpset maroon beret with skills in covert ops, combat search and rescue, direct action, special recon, arctic warfare, and advanced breaching. N\u00f8kk served in Afghanistan and Iraq, often alone in deep undercover behind enemy lines. She received commendations for eliminating hostile insurgents in surgical strikes and was responsible for uncovering Erik \u201cMaverick\u201d Thorn\u2019s location, forwarding that intel to the Unit. N\u00f8kk keeps her identity hidden from all but her fellow operators. NATO\u2019s O&P division recommended N\u00f8kk for Rainbow as one of its deep cover specialists. Psychological report When they looped me in on N\u00f8kk\u2019s real identity, I cracked open her secret dossier with schoolboy glee. I love a good mystery and I was not disappointed. N\u00f8kk\u2019s real identity has been a prickly issue given the potential scandal should it ever be made public. Frankly, had I not known who N\u00f8kk\u2019s father was, I wouldn\u2019t have noticed the family resemblance. But it smacks you in the face when you know the truth. I wondered how N\u00f8kk felt about all this and how it influenced her upbringing. N\u00f8kk tried to dismiss it as one of the realities of the job, but eventually I learned enough to start painting a portrait. N\u00f8kk\u2019s mother raised her, and the pair are close to the point of being best friends. It\u2019s almost tribal how protective they are of each other. N\u00f8kk knew about her father and his family, but it took a while before the family knew about N\u00f8kk. They tried to give N\u00f8kk a better life, but without bringing her into the fold out of fear of courting a major scandal for the family. N\u00f8kk is fiercely loyal to her mother, so I found it surprising N\u00f8kk was loyal to her father out of respect for the family name itself. You\u2019d think there\u2019d be some resentment there, but N\u00f8kk is comfortable quietly serving Queen and Country and everything else that falls under the umbrella; her Darwinist outlook isn\u2019t rooted in her own safety, but rather the betterment of the soldiers of her unit and her country. N\u00f8kk\u2019s ability to keep a secret and maintain a fa\u00e7ade is what makes her a highly capable undercover operative but she is involved in an active mission. Fortunately, N\u00f8kk\u2019s cover identity is currently \u201cin jail,\u201d building up credibility while giving us an incredible opportunity to work with someone of Alibi\u2019s and Bandit\u2019s caliber.

From an early age Fairous worked with engines and competed in robot championships. Her mechanic background was heavily influenced by her father, a military aircraft mechanic. Fairous joined the Australian army reserves to further develop her mechanical engineering skills and to have access to the best equipment. After graduating from university she chose Army branch of the Australian Defense Force, where she honed her mechanical prowess. Fairous also has expertise in a range of weapons, intelligence gathering and close protection duties, and has the ability to adapt to unexpected situations and remain calm in dangerous situations. This unique skill set made her an essential recruit into the SASR Mobility Platoon. Fairous was awarded the National Emergency Medal for her part in saving firefighters.

Psychological report Specialists Tori \u201cGridlock\u201d Fairous and Max \u201cMozzie\u201d Goose caught my attention after the Esperance Bushfire Operation when their daring feat to rescue trapped firefighters earned them a medal. For outsiders, their plan looked horribly reckless, but to me it illustrated what I like in a team. These two have a long history, having first met in high school at a robot wars competition and then again during army training. They\u2019ve been a team ever since. Individually, they\u2019re assets to Rainbow\u2026 but together they dominate. Both consistently demonstrate creativity and skill under pressure, so\u2026 what happens when we position them against one another? And I want to see if Specialist Fairous can maintain her cool among a new team\u2026 not to mention how the team feels about someone with such a formidable presence. [\u2026] Field reports often refer to Fairous\u2019s natural leadership so I\u2019m curious why she consistently turns down promotions. She jokes that it\u2019s too much paperwork, but she seems to back into the role anyway. After her father died, she and her mother discovered the family farm was in debt. Fairous took the lead, rallying her four siblings and extended cousins while using her army salary to save the farm. Fairous isn\u2019t afraid of responsibility and her desire to look out for her family extends to how she interacts with her team. This makes me want to look more closely at her life on the farm. I can hear the fondness for it even when she\u2019s griping about how she has to keep fixing backed-up toilets and broken-down tractors. Fairous\u2019s \u201cget on with things\u201d attitude means that she doesn\u2019t shy from hard work and manages to find humor in every situation.

She enlisted in the military at 19 and later joined the Groupe d'Intervention de La Gendarmerie Royale (GIGR) after graduating from the legendary Fortress. She served 4 tours with the Mountain Infantry Battalion and took part in Flintlock exercises and joint missions with Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative partners. She became her unit\u2019s expert on environmental operations. Between tours, she undertakes solo expeditions. El Maktoub is among the few explorers who can cross the Sahara, climb up the Alps, trek through Asia\u2019s rainforests, march along the Arctic Circle\u2026 and still return to her unit in operational shape. Rain or shine, desert or polar climates, she can walk through it all. Perceptive and resourceful, she\u2019s an expert survivalist who sketches out her trips in her notebook. Psychological report Specialist Sanaa El Maktoub is constantly on the move, thus her codename, \u201cNomad.\u201d The only time she stands still is when she\u2019s sketching in her notebook, and following the recovery of her fingers no less. [\u2026] I think her privileged upbringing instilled her with a private need to succeed, pushing her to conquer mountains and terrains her parents never faced. She likely got accused of being soft in her childhood, and she\u2019s set out ever since to disprove it. In her it\u2019s created a world-class extreme environment expert whose reputation precedes her. [\u2026] Specialist El Maktoub possesses unmatched resilience to survive the elements, and her endurance is famous within military circles. In fact, the first time I encountered Specialist El Maktoub\u2019s name was through a research paper about military fitness assessments. [\u2026] I can see why she\u2019s invaluable to GIGR. She claims that anyone can develop her survivalist and planning skills with experience, but she\u2019s being genuinely modest. Bragging seems antithetical to her and I think that it somehow diminishes her own sense of accomplishment when she has to talk about it. She certainly doesn\u2019t do things the easy way\u2026 her drawing are her photographs. Truth be told, I\u2019m envious of her spirit. [\u2026] First deployed to the Fortress at the start of her military career, she did extensive training under the leadership of Specialist Jalal El Fassi. It would be interesting to see them working together again under different circumstances. [\u2026] During her expeditions, she encountered a number of secluded cultures, like the Maasai in Kenya and the Nenets of Siberia. It\u2019s resulted in self-taught skills in cultural diplomacy. While Rainbow Six recruits specialists from around the world, I\u2019d guess no one else has seen as much of the world on their own as she has. And still, she wants to become the first woman to cross Antarctica, alone on foot. I have no doubt she can accomplish that, but I hope it doesn\u2019t cost her more appendages.

After high school, he enlisted with the U.S. Army and rose in rank over a short period of time. He learned Dari and became an Intelligence Officer, serving in Kabul as foreign reporters, adventurers, and criminals flocked to the city. Thorn was well known in the underground club circuit, and even among locals as a proficient Buzkashi player. Thorn was invited into the Unit as their regional specialist. Following selection, he remained in country, gathering intel, building networks of allies and safe houses, and tracking hostiles. As the situation in Kabul worsened, Thorn kept tabs on Americans, rescuing them when necessary and helping locals escape the violence. He was investigating a missing reporter when The Unit lost contact with him. After two years of silence, he re-emerged with enough intel to dismantle a major insurgency operation. There were still questions regarding his disappearance, but he was exonerated and his testimony sealed. His successful missions, along with his expertise, gained him the attention of Six.

When expats began partying in underground clubs and drinking at restaurants, Specialist Thorn admitted that he knew the \u201cKabubble\u201d was going to pop hard, that Westerners would become easy targets. He saw the writing on the wall before anyone else did. [\u2026] From a young age, Specialist Thorn handled an almost overwhelming amount of sensory input that would have shut down most kids.

His approach is motivated by such singular focus that it makes him one of our more formidable and consistent team members. [\u2026] Something that I try to impart to our team is the value of introspection. Flament, with his Catholic faith, already understands this. He openly discusses his regrets and I can see they give him clarity and purpose. The past isn\u2019t something that he\u2019s forgotten or tried to erase. It motivates him, but has no hold on him.

Flament talks about his love of heavy metal music, his faith, and his son. While the pain of being disowned by his father may never truly fade, it\u2019s prompted Flament to engage with his son more constructively. He treasures their relationship, perhaps because he realizes how close he came to never knowing Alexis at all. In the pictures Flament shares with me I can see the results of his efforts.

Psychological report Grace Nam is playful, clever, serious, and reckless as her codename \u2013 Dokkaebi \u2013 implies. She\u2019s also mischievous. Recent reports say she\u2019s been pushing herself beyond her limits and the team has expressed concern that she\u2019s over-confident. Added to that, we have past disciplinary reports stating that her actions have been \u201cunorthodox,\u201d which I can believe. I was there when she hacked the system; I saw the promise when other people wanted her punished. [\u2026] Nam\u2019s a talented operator. But it\u2019s important to note that she\u2019s one of the younger Rainbow recruits and has little combat experience. This job is intense, and the stakes are high. Some days, I have the impression she would rather be behind her computer, controlling things from where no one can touch her. But she wants to improve; she wants to change. And to do that, she has to challenge herself. I\u2019m certain the over-confidence is about fear. She\u2019s afraid she doesn\u2019t belong, that she isn\u2019t good enough. As for past discinplinary hearings, the shortcomings are with the commanders, not with Nam. A talented hacker isn\u2019t just someone who\u2019s good with code, they\u2019re a creative thinker with the ability to see connections the rest of us can\u2019t. Yes, there\u2019s recklessness. Yes, there\u2019s an element of bravado. But whatever else people may see, they must also admit that there\u2019s a method to Nam\u2019s madness. [\u2026] When I asked about her childhood, she boasted of schoolyard fights and described the extreme academic pressures she faced. The school would shame parents by publically comparing their children. She\u2019s carried this burden of expectation throughout her life, so to have Specialist Chul Kyung \u201cVigil\u201d Hwa chastise her creates a friction that Nam will have to address. [\u2026] She told me her grandparents introduced her to Buddhism when she was little and that she\u2019s recently begun visiting the temple again. I\u2019m reassured. This is her way to cleanse her mind and spirit. Her pursuit of inner balance will allow Nam to achieve her full potential. Her bluster may irritate operators such as Specialist Yumiko \u201cHibana\u201d Imagawa, but I say let her be. -- Dr. Harishva \u201cHarry\u201d Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}, "19": {"Side": "Attacker", "Name": "zofia", "Squad": "Ghosteyes", "Specialties": ",ANTI-GADGET", "HEALTH": 3, "Speed": 1, "Difficulty": 1, "Gadget": "Breach Charge, Claymore", "primary_weapon": "LMG-E, Light Machine Gun, M762, ASSAULT RIFLE", "secondary_weapon": "RG15, HANDGUN", "ability": "KS79 Lifeline", "RealName": "Zofia Bosak", "DateofBirth": "January 28th (Age 36)", "PlaceofBirth": "Wroc\u0142aw, Poland", "Biography": "Biography \u201cIt isn\u2019t about where you end up, it\u2019s about how you make it home.\u201d Zofia Bosak is the eldest daughter of Jan Bosak, respected former commander of the Polish Special Operation Forces unit, GROM. She excelled in the grueling extracurricular training given by her father, learning diverse techniques including some considered questionable. Zofia\u2019s exceptional attitude saw her pass the GROM selection tests with the highest possible scores. She developed extensive skills beyond hand-to-hand combat and marksmanship, specifically survival, sabotage, target extraction, and field medicine. Driven to be the highest performing soldier in any given unit, Zofia is of singular focus in all of her operations. This focus enabled her to single-handedly evacuate hundreds of civilians, including children, during a rescue mission in Guatemala. She has since earned a number of awards and gained the respect of her commanding officers and peers. Zofia stands out as a lateral thinker with decisive, aggressive operational experience and an impeccable track record both on and off the field. Psychological report There are layers to Specialist Zofia \u201cZofia\u201d Bosak and I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface after a handful of meetings. So we\u2019ll take it slow. I\u2019ve read her jacket \u2013 since her father was a public and powerful figure, it means that there are redactions even in her personal file. [\u2026] She wasn\u2019t defensive in our meeting, but she was\u2026 distracted by my role. She didn\u2019t want to be \u201canalyzed,\u201d which is exactly the response I received from her sister, Specialist El\u017cbieta \u201cEla\u201d Bosak. [\u2026] Zofia neither likes discussing herself nor having anyone else discuss her life, especially her military husband and their daughter. She doesn\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d small talk. This made the first twenty minutes of our meeting rather quiet. After offering some family details of my own, she did share a funny incident with her daughter\u2019s morning routine. Knowing how private she is, I want to honor her trust and not mention it here. [\u2026] She is conflicted between pride in her accomplishments and the sense that she was deprived of meaningful choices. When I said that the reports reflect someone exceptional, she laughed. She told me she often feels robotic, as if someone had programmed her and she\u2019s on autopilot. It will be vital to disrupt that sense of powerlessness. [\u2026] Zofia struggles with her father\u2019s death. She doesn\u2019t believe it was suicide and asked if I can recover his autopsy report. I\u2019m not sure I have those kinds of connections, nor do I think it\u2019s necessarily a good idea. His absence already pervades her every thought and I\u2019m not convinced that having an answer would bring her the closure she needs. I\u2019ve encouraged her ongoing efforts to rebuild the relationship with her sister instead, and to cherish the close bonds she has with her teammates and her family. [\u2026] What strikes me most is that Zofia faces the unknown with complete equanimity. Whether it\u2019s due to her training or her upbringing I can\u2019t say. Undoubtedly, it\u2019s a valuable skill. Yet where there is ambivalence there can be no joy, and I find I wish more for her than that. -- Dr. Harishva \u201cHarry\u201d Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}, "20": {"Side": "Attacker", "Name": "ying", "Squad": "Wolfguard", "Specialties": "Line,MAP CONTROL", "HEALTH": 2, "Speed": 2, "Difficulty": 2, "Gadget": "HARD BREACH CHARGE, Smoke Grenade", "primary_weapon": "T-95 LSW, Light Machine Gun, SIX12, SHOTGUN", "secondary_weapon": "Q-929, HANDGUN", "ability": "Candela", "RealName": "Siu Mei Lin", "DateofBirth": "May 12th (Age 33)", "PlaceofBirth": "Hong Kong, Central", "Biography": "Biography \u201cProtecting others is a calling. If you don\u2019t feel it, walk away.\u201d Born in the affluent Central District of Hong Kong, Siu became a close protection operative immediately after high school. Having developed explosive short-range power and combat skills via private tuition, she joined an elite security service with the aim of becoming an all-purpose operative. She traveled to Tel Aviv, Israel, where she spent two years training and serving with the Caracal Battalion, developing an expertise in firearms and combat driving. She returned to Hong Kong, where she joined the police force and then the elite SDU: Flying Tigers. Joint training with the S.A.S. and her creative use of flashbangs earned her the codename, Ying (Firefly). Frequently called upon due to her experience in close protection detail and high-risk operations, Siu is one of the best specialists for operations involving Hong Kong's dense urban population. Psychological report Commanders have a tendency to see Specialist Siu \u201cYing\u201d Mei Lin as conventional. While she can be conservative in her strategic planning, she\u2019s surprisingly quick to change tack. This is perfectly illustrated by the tactical driving maneuvers she\u2019s able to perform, calculating multiple adaptive routes in fractions of a second. It\u2019s genuinely impressive. Though serious and, I noticed, quite fastidious, I can see why clients and teammates feel secure and comfortable with her around. She has a manner that is tailored for putting people at ease, even as she constantly scans the environment for threats. I wondered about the fastidiousness, whether it comes from the thought processes imposed upon her by her training, or if it\u2019s a trait she\u2019s always had. Her response was, \u201cColumn A, Column B.\u201d [\u2026] Her childhood was comfortable \u2013 but, she points out, \u201cboring.\u201d Her mother is a Hong Kong government worker and she grew up surrounded by serious adults, discussing serious things. From a young age, ten or so, Siu would slip away from these \u201cboring conversations\u201d to wander the city. Her favorite memories are of riding the MTR \u2013 the subway \u2013 and jumping off at random stops. And she told me that wherever she travels, in her off-time, she still does this. She says the best way to get to know a city is to let it surprise you. [\u2026] It\u2019s a shame that this sense of adventure isn\u2019t reflected in her official file. After our conversation, it\u2019s clear that Siu has a limitless sense of adventure and fearless enthusiasm for new experiences. She unabashedly gets excited at the idea of joint operations and is often one of the first to volunteer. Invested in her career and role in law enforcement, she never wavers in her dedication\u2026 Which often forces her superiors to order to take time off. So, her seriousness can be misconstrued. I think she\u2019s someone who is always calculating risks. She understands how to wreak havoc on the opposition and unsettle them. The team considers her valuable but she expects clear strategic leadership, and I would caution commanders not to underestimate her. -- Dr. Harishva \u201cHarry\u201d Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}, "21": {"Side": "Attacker", "Name": "jackal", "Squad": "Viperstrike", "Specialties": "MAP CONTROL", "HEALTH": 2, "Speed": 2, "Difficulty": 3, "Gadget": "Claymore, Smoke Grenade", "primary_weapon": "C7E, ASSAULT RIFLE, PDW9, SUBMACHINE GUN, ITA12L, SHOTGUN", "secondary_weapon": "USP40, HANDGUN, ITA12S, SHOTGUN", "ability": "Eyenox Model III", "RealName": "Ryad Ram\u00edrez Al-Hassar", "DateofBirth": "February 29th (Age 49)", "PlaceofBirth": "Ceuta, Spain", "Biography": "Biography \u201cYou can\u2019t escape me, but that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t try.\u201d Al-Hassar\u2019s early years are unclear due to incomplete foster care records. Eventually released into the care of his older brother, Faisal, the two of them were absent from official records for several years until Faisal\u2019s unsolved murder once again left Al-Hassar without a home. Being guided through the tragedy by a sympathetic police officer solidified Al-Hassar\u2019s resolve to find his brother\u2019s murderer and he joined the Cuerpo Nacional de Polic\u00eda the day he turned eighteen. Fast-tracked through the academy with the help of his mentor, Al-Hassar stood out as a quick learner with exceptional lateral thinking. His dogged determination resolved a number of criminal investigations but, unfortunately, the case of his brother\u2019s murder remains open. Tagged by the Grupo Especial de Operaciones for further training, Al-Hassar excelled in off-road driving, abseiling, marksmanship, and knowledge of terrorist groups. He is a frequent guest lecturer and part-time instructor at the CNP academy. Psychological report Ever since he can remember, Specialist Ryad \u201cJackal\u201d Ram\u00edrez Al-Hassar has been nocturnal. Throughout his career it\u2019s been almost a blessing given the demands of the job. Somewhere along the way, though, this has developed into insomnia. At this point, Al-Hassar can\u2019t recall when he last slept well. [\u2026] The murder of his brother is never far from his thoughts. The more time passes and it remains unsolved, the more his frustration grows. I detect guilt in the way he phrases certain things but when I point it out to him he disagrees. Still, he\u2019s agreed to explore it further, especially since the guilt emerged after leaving his job as a criminal investigator. It\u2019s buried deep, and I don\u2019t think it affects his day-to-day work, but neither is it ideal. Al-Hassar has solid relationships with many of his teammates, including Specialists Mike \u201cThatcher\u201d Baker, Emmanuelle \u201cTwitch\u201d Pichon, as well as Olivier \u201cLion\u201d Flament. He\u2019s worked closely with Specialist Elena Mar\u00eda \u201cMira\u201d \u00c1lvarez. I can see in their interactions the deep respect they have for each other. [\u2026] Past experiences have given Al-Hassar a protective nature and a fierce sense of justice. He can be competitive to the point of pettiness, yet in all cases he\u2019s able to check himself before endangering an operation. He described to me that before each op, he visualizes mental switches being flipped. These \u201cswitches\u201d enable him to ratchet up his abilities and maintain focus. Nevertheless, I\u2019d like to delve deeper into this to see if we can help him manage to balance his personal world as well. I need to ensure he isn\u2019t experiencing extreme shifts in mood outside of the workplace. [\u2026] I\u2019ve encouraged him to live life for himself. He\u2019s taken some steps toward this by teaching at the academy. Not only will his talents prove invaluable to the young police cadets, but it forms connections that Al-Hassar didn\u2019t realize he was missing. I\u2019ve also just learned that our conversation prompted Al-Hassar to volunteer with at-risk youth.

Encouraged by her family, she has been practicing the long-range martial art of Ky\u016bd\u014d from an early age and possesses the ability to assess multiple factors simultaneously while executing precise, controlled, and fluid motions. Having trained with CTUs around the world including the SAS, FBI SWAT, and GIGN, Hibana has acquired a rare tactical versatility, with proficiency in tubular (bus, train, and airplane) assaults. During her studies at the National Police Academy, she gained the nickname Hibana due to her improvised explosive devices.

Psychological report Specialist Yumiko \u201cHibana\u201d Imagawa has considerable talents. I only know a few others with as many commendations. Inspiring operatives from diverse backgrounds and putting people at ease comes naturally to her, and she\u2019s certainly gracious with my poor attempts at Japanese. [\u2026] I enjoy our conversations. Imagawa is very lyrical in the way she recounts her experiences. For someone who\u2019s been around the world and encountered so many cultures, her favorite stories are of her childhood home. Like when her father would come home from his work as a butcher, and Imagawa\u2019s mother wouldn\u2019t allow him inside until they had hosed him down in the garden. The image of her drenched, barefoot father dancing under the spray of frigid water was a great amusement to the family. I like the story. Memories likese these keep us grounded and I wondered if training in Kyudo had fostered this appreciation in her. When I suggested that she had an aura of inner serenity, she laughed and called me a \u201chippie.\u201d [\u2026] I\u2019d like to see if she can influence some of the others to maintain that calm sensibility. Her training with so many CTUs makes her an ideal fit for the role. Already within Rainbow Imagawa is universally respected. [\u2026] I sense that Imagawa\u2019s motivations are stoked by some inner fire, but she also has a competitive drive with fellow operatives. The debrief reports indicate as much. [\u2026] Imagawa does appear to be uncustomarily impatient with Specialist Grace \u201cDokkaebi\u201d Nam, despite them often spending lab time together. The dynamic surprises me because I can\u2019t quite pin it down. When I asked, Imagawa said I was mistaken, and Dokkaebi seems not to notice or to care. I\u2019ve read the reports and my hunch hovers over some joint training exercise with the GIGN. Imagawa may envy Nam\u2019s easy self-assurance, which corresponds with records concerning Imagawa\u2019s younger sister. Still, I\u2019d like to explore this further. They aren\u2019t necessarily at loggerheads, but it may affect future operations in some way we can\u2019t foresee if I can\u2019t determine the source of the rupture in Imagawa\u2019s calm. -- Dr. Harishva \u201cHarry\u201d Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}, "23": {"Side": "Attacker", "Name": "capitao", "Squad": "Viperstrike", "Specialties": "Line,MAP CONTROL", "HEALTH": 1, "Speed": 3, "Difficulty": 2, "Gadget": "Claymore, HARD BREACH CHARGE", "primary_weapon": "PARA-308, ASSAULT RIFLE, M249, Light Machine Gun", "secondary_weapon": "PRB92, HANDGUN", "ability": "Tactical Crossbow", "RealName": "Vicente Souza", "DateofBirth": "November 17th (Age 49)", "PlaceofBirth": "Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Nova Igua\u00e7u)", "Biography": "Biography \u201cFocusing only on the bad things in life will keep you from seeing the many opportunities to do good.\u201d The youngest of three children, Souza was raised in Nova Igua\u00e7u, a suburb of Rio de Janeiro. The murder of his older brother by drug dealers prompted Souza to join the Pol\u00edcia Militar, where he was trained in a wide range of tactical weapons and breaching strategies. During a raid against a crime cartel, Souza was ambushed and taken hostage. Despite the loss of an eye and other brutal treatment, his inner resolve kept him alive for two months before he was rescued. Believing Souza perfectly embodied their motto, Victory over Death, and given his urban warfare experience, Batalh\u00e3o de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Policiais Especiais (BOPE) recruited him into their ranks following his recovery. He has become a renowned expert in the organization and psychological behavior of criminal gangs, and his fight to end drug crime has put a cartel bounty on his head.

Every step of every decision reinforces his commitment to protecting his family and making their world safer. Raised in a close-knit community, he extends that tradition to his own three children. It\u2019s hardly surprising he never got over the trauma of losing his older brother. He named his eldest son in honor of him, and they often share stories to keep his memory alive. Souza\u2019s favorite moments are when his house is crowded with family, and the quiet, safe surroundings he\u2019s created in his own home give him a chance to relax his guard, knowing that they\u2019re all within his reach and protected. [\u2026] He admitted that he doesn\u2019t trust his children\u2019s friends, yet he also worries that he can be too overbearing. It sounds like he raised them to be smart about how they live their lives, though I suspect the fear of losing them will always be more intense for him than for other parents with less tragic pasts. [\u2026] Since there was talk of removing him from the field following his capture and mutilation, I thought it best we discuss how he feels about that ordeal, long ago though it may now be. It wasn\u2019t something I wanted to bring up during our first meeting, so I reserved it for subsequent discussions. What\u2019s clear is that it shaped him. Souza is dedicated to justice and protecting those who cannot protect themselves. It\u2019s made him relentless. At any given moment he is deciphering every aspect of how these gangs function in order to find a weakness. It\u2019s a daunting task that one member of law enforcement can\u2019t fix alone. [\u2026] His incomparable resolve and years of unique experiences make him a valuable asset for any team, but it\u2019s crucial that he maintains some distance between his role as a protector and his sense of self.

Joining the military offered him the ideal opportunity to pursue an academic education while learning a wide range of skills that fueled his adventurous spirit. After his initial military stint, Jenson focused on the US Navy SEALs as his ultimate career goal. Driven to succeed in his profession and his private life, he has climbed Mount Everest, participated in US sailing championships, and has sailed around the world on several occasions. Psychological report Specialist Craig \u201cBlackbeard\u201d Jenson has a commanding presence, complemented by a boisterous sense of humor and a booming laugh. Outside his operational role, Jenson doesn\u2019t appear to take too many things seriously. He was relaxed and open throughout our conversation, describing himself as \u201cgung-ho and an all-in kind of guy.\u201d I have to admit I don\u2019t hear \u201cgung-ho\u201d too often. [\u2026] Athletic, rugged, a mountain climber and competitive sailor, Jenson tells me that he\u2019s most himself when he\u2019s in nature. He says the wilderness encourages adaptation and builds willpower, tolerance, and acceptance. This seems to be something he\u2019s been cultivating since his youth. I asked him if there was a job out there that he would do if he wasn\u2019t in the military. He told me that he thought about becoming an oceanographer but right now there\u2019s \u201cstill a lot of shine on being a SEAL\u201d. [\u2026] I asked him when he first discovered his taste for adventure. At five years old he snuck out of bed and hauled all the family camping equipment into the woods behind his house. He camped there for two days, then returned so his parents wouldn\u2019t worry. He later learned that they knew exactly where he was and had been keeping an eye on him. He regrets not staying out longer. [\u2026] He says his great-grandfather quit his job one day, left his wife and kids, and went North to be a gold miner. Jenson says he shares that same passion to explore, though he\u2019s not at all interested in abandoning his own wife and children. [\u2026] Present day pirates are a serious concern to the Navy, and Jenson has participated in multiple anti-piracy task forces. That said, when at home he enjoys playing swashbuckler pirates with his kids. Jenson says pirates were egalitarian, and that it was similar to how a Rainbow team might conduct an operation. [\u2026] He\u2019s a solid operator with a clear image of his role. He\u2019s successful at it and well-liked by his team.

I enjoy our sessions together. In our first encounters, he was formal but not necessarily closed off. I can see why, in social settings, he\u2019s described as laid-back. In the field, his tendency to meld well with a wide range of people is recognized by those with a tactical eye, but is appreciated by all who work with him. [\u2026] C\u00f4t\u00e9 has an adventurous spirit and, for someone who is a veteran of the forces, approaches his work with fresh enthusiasm. He was raised with tales of his voyageur ancestors who paddled the rivers across Canada, worked as fur trappers, and helped map the north for the railroad and mining industries. He told me he only recently discovered that his great-grandfather almost drowned in rapids but was rescued by his Mohawk friend. If it hadn\u2019t been for this friend, C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s father wouldn\u2019t have been born. So as thanks, C\u00f4t\u00e9 told me, he plans to learn the language. This is a great illustration of C\u00f4t\u00e9 at his core. Though he is eager to make a difference in the world, his approach is sensible and realistic. He works toward actual results and the effort required doesn\u2019t deter him. [\u2026] He grew up in close-knit family, the middle of three. I gather the entire family is very physically active and C\u00f4t\u00e9 says most of his activities are centred around the outdoors. That said, he was happy to share his fascination with mechanical puzzles. It\u2019s an intricate maze of metal pieces that fit together and the challenge is to reassemble them. C\u00f4t\u00e9 told me that his uncle taught him how to make them and he\u2019s been doing it ever since.

His athleticism elevated him to the position of Captain of the 1998 Scotland Under-20s Rugby Union Team. Following a long family tradition of military service, Cowden joined the 3rd UK Mechanised Division of the British Army. His drive and physique suit the division\u2019s historical nickname of \u201cIron Sides.\u201d Cowden\u2019s first assignment was in the Armoured Division where he studied engineering and specialized in upgrading the infantry combat vehicles. From there, he developed various breaching tactics. He was then recruited into the SAS, where he holds multiple records in speed and strength. An expert in mechanical, ballistic, explosive and thermal breaching strategies, Cowden is the operator to choose for quick and relatively silent destruction. Psychological report It\u2019s part of my job to understand where the country shapes the person and Specialist Seamus \u201cSledge\u201d Cowden seems indelibly shaped by the rugged terrain where he was born. It isn\u2019t just his imposing presence and athleticism. I can\u2019t help but feel that his personality evokes the wilderness as well. He\u2019s stoic and proud, though admits that he can be hot-headed at times. Field reports describe his courage, leadership, and extensive operational experience as much as they mention his unpredictability. He\u2019s much more than a \u201cgentle giant\u201d as some suggest. [\u2026] Cowden is something of a raconteur, and for much of our discussion he told me one rowdy tale after another. When he was twelve he cobbled a hang glider together out of boat sails and launched himself off his house. He broke both ankles. During military training, he accidentally collapsed his entire sleeping barrack while testing a new breaching technique, and another time he sank a captain\u2019s motorcycle by riding it off the pier because he wanted to see how far it would travel on the surface \u2013 not far, I gather. His stories aren\u2019t just to entertain. They help to establish a comfortable connection. It\u2019s such a casual, offhand leadership style. [\u2026] Cowden views his fellow operators as family, Specialist Mike \u201cThatcher\u201d Baker in particular, who he credits for convincing him to switch to the Caber. Numerous Rainbow operators refer to Sledge as one of the easiest operators to work with. [\u2026] Overall, Cowden is easy-going and unpretentious, though he gets ruffled at the mention of politics. A self-proclaimed news junkie, he doesn\u2019t shy away from debates. In fact, it\u2019s the reason he joined the military, and why one of his brothers is currently an elected MP. Cowden understands that while on assignment Rainbow operators don\u2019t voice their political opinions and so far there hasn\u2019t been any issue. We should trust that he can control his hot-headedness.

At the age of eighteen he enlisted for active military duty despite family pressure to join the family trade as a stevedore. Immediately thrown into politically-charged conflicts, Baker\u2019s performance was exemplary. Further training and another conflict gave him a Distinguished Flying Cross and Conspicuous Gallantry Cross. His keen sense of observation and decisive manner, combined with his close-quarter combat techniques, made him invaluable on VIP protection detail. With extensive field experience and proficiency in SAS tactics, Baker is a critical asset to any Rainbow operation. He has honed his expertise with protective measures and electronic counter-measures and frequently works with engineers to advance the equipment. As a Warrant Officer Class 1 (Regimental Sergeant Major) Baker serves as a respected and effective mentor to new recruits. Baker maintains his agility training, continuing abseiling, and has broken numerous mountain climbing records. Psychological report Knowing that Specialist Mike \u201cThatcher\u201d Baker is cynical toward bureaucracy, I wasn\u2019t surprised that he was reluctant to meet me. I needed a different approach. Baker lives aboard the Iron Maggie, a boat in drydock that he repairs in his spare time. It\u2019s his \u201cretirement plan.\u201d I suspect he moved there temporarily when his wife divorced him, but now he knows no other civilian home. [\u2026] Baker has a distinguished record of military service. He\u2019s respected and in some cases idolized by those he mentors. When he welcomed me to his home, I could see why people describe him as down-to-earth. There\u2019s more to Baker\u2019s gruff, no-nonsense exterior \u2013 it just required some effort for him to trust me. [\u2026] Raised in a coastal town, Baker has a strong connection with the water. We spent our entire meeting on the deck of his ship, overlooking the cold sea. Being someone who isn\u2019t handy \u2013 mastering a paper airplane as a kid was the peak of my craft \u2013 I wanted to know what Baker likes about boat building and working with his hands. He told me that besides appreciating the precision of it, he liked shaping the wood into something that has a purpose. I suggested it was similar to how he mentors recruits. He replied that he doesn\u2019t care about the \u201cwhy\u201d of things the way us \u201cUni types\u201d do. [\u2026] Specialist Seamus \u201cSledge\u201d Cowden is one of his few close friends. Thatcher\u2019s tolerance of Specialist Mark \u201cMute\u201d Chandar surprised me, since Thatcher is impatient with youthful bluster. When asked, Thatcher would only say: \u201cMute\u2019s a clever kid.\u201d He sounded almost envious. I wonder if Mute reflects someone Thatcher wishes he had been. [\u2026] While by no means a Luddite, Baker does have an aversion to technology. To him, it\u2019s a tool \u2013 like a hammer or screwdriver \u2013 nothing more. The idea that people come to rely on it as a crutch is what annoys him. I suggested that he spend time in the engineering lab with Specialists Masaru \u201cEcho\u201d Enatsu and Emmanuelle \u201cTwitch\u201d Pichon.

Cohen was raised in Israel, excelling in Mathematics and Physics. She earned a degree in Structural Engineering at Tel Aviv University and spent a few semesters at Boston University. Cohen then enlisted in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). After undergoing the rigorous twenty-two month training for the elite Air Force unit, Shaldag, she served five years. Skilled in ground and airborne operations, all-weather and all-terrain navigation and reconnaissance, she was invaluable in Operation Orchard. Moving to the US to work with FBI SWAT, Cohen applied her degree in Engineering and gift in structural resistance to develop advanced demolition tactics and equipment. Along with Hebrew, Cohen is fluent in Arabic, English, French and Greek. Psychological report I had several meetings with Specialist Eliza \u201cAsh\u201d Cohen before I gave up on convincing her to not see me as a commanding officer. She asked so many probing questions, it was starting to feel as though she were analyzing me. [\u2026] Cohen isn\u2019t interested in discussing her childhood. There\u2019s resentment toward a judgmental grandmother, but no lasting trauma. Military service acted as an escape from family tensions and appealed to her ordered and focused personality. Cohen added that she appreciates high-risk, high-reward scenarios, but didn\u2019t elaborate on what level of personal risk is acceptable. Her identity is intertwined with her military training and operations. Extracting anything personal from the tangle is difficult. Cohen is cautious and doesn\u2019t cultivate many close relationships. Her bond with Specialist Miles \u201cCastle\u201d Campbell is therefore important to her \u2013 and I would say to the team as well. It\u2019s certainly a good pairing. Campbell\u2019s amenable personality enables Cohen to step out of her comfort zone without feeling self-conscious or judged. [\u2026] Cohen uses other people\u2019s assessments to describe herself: She told me that Specialists Dominic \u201cBandit\u201d Brunsmeier and James \u201cSmoke\u201d Porter tell her she\u2019s \u201ctoo serious,\u201d while others describe her as \u201cintense,\u201d and that she enjoys being proven right. So I asked if she thought those descriptions were accurate. She told me that she only cares about whether the other operators respect her. I\u2019m confident they do. [\u2026] On operations, Cohen is exemplary: She thinks fast, and her aggressive style almost always puts her at an advantage. During debriefs, however, I\u2019ve noticed a different kind of focus. The residual stress of combat causes her to dwell on every misstep, perceived or real. Self-evaluation is understandable from someone so highly skilled, but it also has an effect on her team. It\u2019s important to encourage her to process the events as a joint effort and not simply assume the critique alone. Cohen \u2013 like all operators \u2013 knows there will be situations she can\u2019t prepare for. And yet, she alone allows the stress of the unknown to eat at her.

He brought his experience and skills to the FBI, where he spent a number of years as a field agent within the Hazardous Materials Response Unit. Seeking more dynamic environments, Trace transferred into FBI SWAT, where he excelled at developing new barricade protocols. He then earned a spot in Rainbow where he\u2019s shown further interest in research and development on gadget upgrades. Trace\u2019s hometown of Plano has a major concentration of Chinese Americans, and as such Trace has conversational level of Mandarin.

They used his imposing form whenever there was a need to show a strong police presence, earning him a spot in the Mobile Gendarmerie where the focus was on crowd control as well as military and counter-terrorism patrol missions. Tour\u00e9\u2019s push for extensive training provided him with a broad skillset and earned him a position in the GIGN. Though he\u2019s best utilized for his breaching techniques, Tour\u00e9 also has training in combat engineering and reconnaissance. When not deployed with Rainbow, Tour\u00e9 is an instructor at GIGN. Psychological report Specialist Gilles \u201cMontagne\u201d Tour\u00e9\u2019s imposing presence, along with his unwavering gaze, is impressive and (as a tactic) I can see how it can be unsettling. He\u2019s a man of few words, even among his friends. I chose to visit him at one of the GIGN Training Centers so that he\u2019d be more comfortable talking. [\u2026] Observing Tour\u00e9 with his trainees gave me a better sense of him. In this capacity he was accessible, fair, and even gregarious. [\u2026] We started by discussing his role as an instructor. Tour\u00e9 was excited that Rainbow continues to evolve and is proud to be a part of it. He told me there\u2019s always a lot to learn from his peers and that, lately, he\u2019s been trying to stretch beyond his comfort zone. He has certainly taken the lead on including more virtual simulation in our training. He\u2019s hoping to incorporate the unique skills of operators such as Specialist Grace \u201cDokkaebi\u201d Nam in his next sessions. [\u2026] Tour\u00e9 has a naturally protective nature. His choice to enter law enforcement speaks more to that than his family\u2019s military history. The middle of four \u2013 his two brothers are also in the military \u2013 Tour\u00e9 said that the family raised them to be protectors.

His sister finished her police training but switched to teaching when she felt that was where she could do the most good. Because Tour\u00e9 has an understated confidence, I was surprised when he expressed doubt about his role in Rainbow. Many of our operators are exceptionally skilled with languages. Tour\u00e9 isn\u2019t. None of the reports suggest this is an issue, but even a perceived weakness can become debilitating. I encouraged him to select one \u2013 only one \u2013 language to focus on studying, and asked some of the other specialists to make an effort to include him in their conversations.

Her superiors quickly encouraged Pichon to study engineering while continuing her career in the military. From the start, Pichon\u2019s focus has been on adaptable technology that aids soldiers in the field. While there is much praise for her technological achievements, Pichon\u2019s tactical prowess and ability to problem solve quickly and efficiently make her a crucial operational asset. Pichon's unique combination of talents made her well-suited for GIGN and, later, Rainbow. She is fluent in French, English, and German and her current research focus is AI.

According to Specialist Emmanuelle \u201cTwitch\u201d Pichon\u2019s field reports, it\u2019s the most concise description for her. Of course, it doesn\u2019t encapsulate all of who she is. There\u2019s more depth and surprises to Pichon than anyone expects. [\u2026] There is some academic rivalry between Pichon and her sister, a physicist, but nothing serious, she tells me. It\u2019s endemic of the perfection her family instilled in their children. Her father told her to strive to be incredible every day and that it will resonate out into the universe. [\u2026] The Rainbow team speaks highly of her both operationally and in a social setting. Specialist Gustave \u201cDoc\u201d Kateb, in particular, appreciates her intuition and empathy, while others such as Specialist Olivier \u201cLion\u201d Flament praise her technological know-how. I wanted to know how Pichon interprets technological creativity. She said it\u2019s the way she sees things differently and yet remains aware that she\u2019s seeing things differently. So I suppose I would add \u201cphilosopher\u201d to her myriad descriptors. [\u2026] She\u2019s a very hands-on researcher. The manner in which she gets right up close to a robot, interacting with it the way someone would a child or pet, illustrates her innate compassion. Pichon is currently teaching AI empathy so that it can, in turn, teach it to humans. I\u2019d love to delve into this further, and have plans to visit the lab. [\u2026] Because Pichon\u2019s passion for technology as a way to improve quality of life drives her in research and in her military career, I wonder if she isn\u2019t at times being too idealistic.

K\u00f6tz uses humor to help diffuse stressful situations. It\u2019s appreciated by his teammates and holds more value than his previous commanders gave him credit for. [\u2026] It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t take his job seriously. In fact, quite the opposite: On a number of occasions he was the first to rush a barricade and has often placed the team\u2019s safety over his own. The fact that K\u00f6tz prefers to not consider his acts as heroic is a quirk of his personality, but certainly no detriment to his performance. [\u2026] I like to think of myself as physically fit. Of course I realize these specialists are in a class of their own but even there, K\u00f6tz stands out as exceptional. He jokes about how often our med team files requests to strap him to some new machine so they can keep testing his physical limits.

[\u2026] Field reports mention that Weiss can become obsessive when tackling challenges. In the same vein, she suffers from bouts of insomnia.

There\u2019s always a lesson to be learned.\u201d Svensson was a curious boy growing up in Uppsala, where his parents encouraged his fascination with animal biology by enrolling him in every science class they could find. On track to attend his hometown\u2019s University to pursue his passion, his focus shifted following his mandatory service. He learned that he had an affinity for physical fitness and tactical organization and became especially interested in how combat affects soldiers\u2019 emotional states. Following his service period, he studied neurochemistry and joined the Swedish Armed Forces, quickly earning his way up. As a communicator in the Special Operations Group, he expanded his skillset and aimed to develop strategies that would improve his peers\u2019 performance. When his project to create formulas that alter soldiers\u2019 emotions was denied, his insistence caused him to be discharged. Estranged from his family and made a pariah in the scientific and military communities, he had few options when Deimos approached him. With his newfound partner and funding, Svensson developed his technology until it became evident that he was being used to create a dangerous weapon. Taking his research with him, Svensson escaped Deimos\u2019s facility and sought out Rainbow. PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORT I understand the squad\u2019s reluctance in accepting Specialist Emil \u201cFenrir\u201d Svensson as one of our own. I was just as skeptical when he approached us, but I couldn\u2019t ignore the possibility that his information on our enemy might give us the upper hand. I figured we could decide what to do with him later. Deimos is dangerous, and I considered that Svensson might be a spy, so I had Buck join me during interviews. On paper, Fenrir is exactly the type of person Rainbow would seek out to recruit. He\u2019s an intellectual, and an ambitious tactician in peak form. As I learned more about his career path, I realized the traits that led to his military discharge are ones I expect in a member of Redhammer: unflinching drive, conviction, and readiness to put himself in harm\u2019s way when necessary. I can\u2019t fully absolve him of his work with Deimos, but I can relate to the regret Svensson feels. He had no prior knowledge of the enemy\u2019s operations, so I can\u2019t blame him for accepting the offer. It's easy to get tunnel vision when pursuing groundbreaking research, but eventually you have to come to your senses and notice what's around you. The turning point for him was witnessing Deimos use an unstable version of his fear toxin on his colleagues. As he puts it, his work was meant to help people, not hurt them. The way I see it, I have my hands on an excellent specialist who knows more about our enemy than any of us do. I\u2019d call that an asset. He passed every test I threw his way, and Buck didn\u2019t raise any red flags. Kaid has protested openly against Fenrir, but he\u2019ll have to come around. We need to take Deimos down. -- Captain Jordan \u201cThermite\u201d Trace, Redhammer Squad Leader"}, "37": {"Side": "Defender", "Name": "solis", "Squad": "Ghosteyes", "Specialties": "SUPPORT", "HEALTH": 2, "Speed": 2, "Gadget": "Impact Grenade, Bulletproof camera", "primary_weapon": "P90, SUBMACHINE GUN, ITA12L, SHOTGUN", "secondary_weapon": "SMG-11, Machine Pistol", "ability": "Spec-IO Electro-Sensor", "RealName": "Ana Valentina D\u00edaz", "DateofBirth": "September 18th (Age 37)", "PlaceofBirth": "Zipaquir\u00e1, Colombia", "Biography": "Biography \u201cPeople lie. Data does not.\u201d D\u00edaz grew up comfortably in an otherwise dangerous time for Colombia, where her close-knit family unit taught her the value of truth. As the eldest of four she felt a duty to protect others, which prompted her to join the National Police. Balancing her passion for computers and literature with her unflinching drive, she excelled in investigative work. After receiving a commendation for uncovering corruption among her peers, she pushed through special operations training and earned herself a spot in the AFEAU. D\u00edaz was surprisingly proficient in ballistics and close combat for someone with her cerebral profile, which made her a well-rounded specialist. She worked in counterintelligence with the National Intelligence Directorate and led an initiative to partner with developers of Augmented Reality technology to enhance her unit\u2019s efficiency. She simultaneously led a secret life online, monitoring systemic corruption through the dark web and ultimately discovering transactions that tied several officials to trafficking rings in South America. The crackdown that followed got her on Specialist Santiago \u201cFlores\u201d Lucero\u2019s radar, who recommended her to Specialist Taina \u201cCaveira\u201d Pereira for recruitment. Psychological report As a scholar of linguistics, Specialist Ana \u201cSolis\u201d D\u00edaz speaks in precise terms, leaving nothing to the imagination. As she explained, \u201cevery moment of confusion is a risk, a danger, so clarity is always essential.\u201d She brought up an Operation in Bogot\u00e1 to illustrate this, where she was assigned to the protection of a VIP. Her charge\u2019s refusal to explain who was pursuing him (and why) meant that D\u00edaz\u2019s unit was acting with limited information, and several of them were gravely injured as a result. This reminded D\u00edaz of why she initially wanted to leave this career path. D\u00edaz was shaken when she discovered her first commanding officer\u2019s involvement with a local criminal element. Her community was endangered when the police force engaged in a shootout with the criminals they were supplying, and civilians were caught in the crossfire. Among the losses was D\u00edaz\u2019s aunt after whom she was named. The familial nickname of \u201cAnita\u201d never felt right to her afterwards, calling it a mark of shame, something she must make up for. \u201cA corrupt system is one where trust is scarce, inequality is the norm, and the people we are meant to protect become expendable.\u201d She refuses to make allowances for anyone who enables such environments. She chose to reach higher echelons to effect change not out of ambition, but because she feels like if she doesn\u2019t do it, no one will. [\u2026] I noticed D\u00edaz was quick to bond with Zero, and she confessed that she was already familiar with his career through her extracurricular research. She sees in him a legend from which she can learn, taking every opportunity to train with him and interrogate him over coffee. He doesn\u2019t seem to mind a student who listens, and a mentor could do D\u00edaz some good. [\u2026] As confident as she is in her abilities, D\u00edaz displayed some agitation when discussing the upcoming Operation. She puts a lot of pressure on herself and hinges her self-worth on success, so I\u2019m not surprised that she\u2019s afraid of failure.

I\u2019m still trying to determine if her dedication to Bushido teachings was encouraged by, or in spite of, her relationship with her father. [\u2026] Fujiwara\u2019s profile is characterised by a high level of self-control, independence, and extraversion. What I question is her emotional stability. Her performance as a bodyguard shows that she can keep a cool head amidst chaotic situations and is unarguably someone you can trust with your life. Her reaction to Yahata\u2019s death is uncharacteristic with her professionalism and does concern me. Fujiwara refuses to answer to her given name until she uncovers the truth surrounding the death of Masayuki Yahata.

When she wasn\u2019t outwrestling one of her five older brothers, she was helping her parents breed and raise thoroughbreds for the tracks as well as for the mounted division of Ireland\u2019s national police force. It\u2019s a Hawthorn family tradition to eventually abandon farm life for the military, as it\u2019s considered to be \u201ceasier\u201d. Thorn, however chose to follow the horses and joined the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na. After four years of impeccable service she applied for the Garda\u2019s elite tactical branch, the Emergency Response Unit. Only five percent of applicants pass the grueling two-week entrance exam. Thorn not only finished top of her class, but would routinely assist other applicants through the training gauntlet. She quickly rose through the ranks as a tactical weapons expert and helped re-design the unit\u2019s obstacle course, referring to the former design as a \u201cwalk in the park.\u201d Word of her course reached the ears of Caveira, who upon barely completing the training exclaimed with exhaustion \u201cYou want a job?\u201d Psychological report \"If ever you want to feel physically inept, shake hands with a farmer.

In that brief instant I experienced a life\u2019s worth of hard work, discipline, tremendous strength, and total control. I knew then and there she\u2019d fit right in. Growing up on the farm, Brianna had to fight for attention, and everything else. Her mother and father were too busy and left most of the parenting to her older brothers. And while she may have been picked on when she was little, it all stopped the day she broke her oldest brother\u2019s nose. She possesses a strong sense of justice and has zero tolerance for bullying [\u2026] When we discussed her decision to join the police force, she recounted with some reservation an incident involving her youngest brother, Liam. His many addictions led him to the racetracks, where he fell into the pockets of organized crime members.

Brianna joined An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na the very next day, and never saw Liam again. [\u2026] Brianna often glosses over hard topics with humor and is quick to suppress her emotions.

While benefitting from the guidance of community elders and indigenous instructors, this program sparked an interest in preserving and protecting what she loved most, the Nakoda way of life. After joining the Canadian Armed Forces Thunderbird worked her way through flight school. Remembering her mother\u2019s emphasis on the value of balance, Thunderbird felt since the CAF taught her to take lives, she should also learn how to save them.

Psychological report When Nomad first brought Specialist Mina \u201cThunderbird\u201d Sky to our attention I wasn\u2019t surprised by her recommendation. Sky is an accomplished medical officer, aviation mechanic and pilot. She seems to have the necessary drive, training and temperament to meld with Nomad\u2019s team. I was, however, surprised that this was the first I have heard of her. Had it not been for Sky\u2019s medical training Nomad may not have survived the incident in the North. I wonder if that encounter inspired Nomad to welcome the friendship of a hunter like Specialist Frost. Given her background I feel that Frost and Sky would have much to bond over. Family is clearly important to Sky, and that goes beyond immediate blood ties. The Nakoda community had as big an influence on and hand in raising Sky as her parents. The knowledge passed down is not solely a history but a heritage to be practiced and preserved as a way of life. Overall, Sky has an emotional awareness that\u2019s born from understanding and acceptance. She seeks balance in everything she does. She describes the world and the human body as an engine. First you need to understand its purpose, and then how it functions. If a wire is shredded you can\u2019t fix it with a screw, but a screw can hold a bone in place as it heals. I can appreciate the analogy, listen first then find a solution. That\u2019s not to say she doesn\u2019t lose her temper. What \u201cgets under her skin\u201d as Sky puts it is lack of respect. Respect for others, whether it\u2019s their way of life or their right to life is essential to her principles. Sky\u2019s evaluation of risks seems to be tempered by her confidence and experience.

[\u2026] Al Hadid\u2019s phenomenal self-control puts my own efforts at mastery to shame. Even Specialist Yumiko \u201cHibana\u201d Imagawa has commented on the utter calm he exudes. The difference between them is that he allows his control to waver at selected moments, in service of his larger goals. He has turned a crippling affliction into overwhelming strength. This is an extraordinary skill that I have encouraged him to share, when and where he will. [\u2026] Other operators are making inroads with Al Hadid, but progress is slow. I suspect, like many subjected to the depths of human cruelty, trusting others will not come naturally. Disquieting though it is to admit, Rainbow may be the one place where he is amongst those who can best understand his past. -- Dr. Harishva \"Harry\" Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}, "44": {"Side": "Defender", "Name": "wamai", "Squad": "Nighthaven", "Specialties": "ADGET,TRAPPER", "HEALTH": 2, "Speed": 2, "Difficulty": 2, "Gadget": "PROXIMITY ALARM, Impact Grenade", "primary_weapon": "AUG A2, ASSAULT RIFLE, MP5K, SUBMACHINE GUN", "secondary_weapon": "D-40, Handgun, P12, HANDGUN", "ability": "Mag-net System", "RealName": "Ng\u0169g\u0129 Muchoki Furaha", "DateofBirth": "June 1st (Age 28)", "PlaceofBirth": "Lamu, Kenya", "Biography": "\u201cThe closer you are to death, the more vibrant life becomes.\u201d BACKGROUND Born to a fishing family on the coast of Kenya, Furaha spent his childhood hunting sharks and collecting lost treasures from the ocean floor of the Lamu Archipelago. It soon became apparent that he was able to stay underwater far longer than his peers, and medical exploration revealed an abnormal physiology that contributed to Furaha\u2019s long-held belief that he was \u201cnot from here.\u201d When the opportunity arose to join the Kenyan Navy, and later the Kenya Special Boat Unit, he put his skills to good use. He quickly drew the attention of generals within the navy as well as the worldwide scientific community for his prolific and frequent record-breaking freedives. He later transitioned to NIGHTHAVEN, drawn by the promise of more down-time and a private boat to take him to where his next dive site might be. PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORT Talking to Specialist Ng\u0169g\u0129 Muchoki \u201cWamai\u201d Furaha is like talking underwater. Words are exchanged, but it\u2019s not certain that meaning follows. [\u2026] Surprisingly, I find myself refreshed by our exchanges. There\u2019s a purity that comes with free association, with being able to jump from one abstract concept to the next. Furaha senses, too, when other people are likely to get lost \u2013 at the moments where I find myself most without an anchor, his quick smile and change of topic reassures me that we have not gone beyond all human thought, never to return. [\u2026] It makes me question whether I should be more flexible in my thought processes, followed quickly by wondering, if I were, who I would become. [\u2026] The existential questions raised by someone who spends their free time anoxic are not those we ask ourselves often. And, perhaps deprived of Furaha\u2019s particular sensitivity to these topics, I\u2019m not certain I see value in them. His unaccustomed approach results in strategies that are completely alien. Furaha\u2019s ability to conceptualize 3D space in not just the horizontal but the vertical is something I\u2019ve only seen in the most obsessive of pilots. Yet his internal dimension is surprisingly absent. [\u2026] I once spoke with a renowned monk who had spent his life in pursuit of \u201ccomplete zero.\u201d In him, I saw the same depth of being I see now in Furaha, but where many people\u2019s spirituality serves to shore up those parts of their personality that they most admire, theirs is the inverse. Furaha\u2019s life is in service to his spirituality. Anoxia is part of his addiction. [\u2026] In all of my consultations, I strive for neutrality. Furaha is a talented operator, capable, intelligent, and unpredictable. His ability to put a room at ease is invaluable. Yet one never has the sense that they hold the whole picture of him in their mind. Like the nitrogen that must disperse back into the diver\u2019s body before resurfacing, Furaha\u2019s true nature is diffuse. To define him would be to limit him, and I have the distinct sense that there is nothing he would despise more. -- Dr. Harishva \"Harry\" Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}, "45": {"Side": "Defender", "Name": "goyo", "Squad": "Redhammer", "Specialties": "NTRY,TRAPPER", "HEALTH": 2, "Speed": 2, "Difficulty": 2, "Gadget": "PROXIMITY ALARM, Bulletproof camera, Impact Grenade", "primary_weapon": "Vector .45 ACP, SUBMACHINE GUN, TCSG12, SHOTGUN", "secondary_weapon": "P229, HANDGUN", "ability": "Volc\u00e1n Canister", "RealName": "C\u00e9sar Ruiz Hern\u00e1ndez", "DateofBirth": "June 20th (Age 31)", "PlaceofBirth": "Culiac\u00e1n Rosales, Mexico", "Biography": "Biography \u201cA person is never more honest than when they think they\u2019re alone.\u201d C\u00e9sar Ruiz Hern\u00e1ndez was eleven years old when a bomb destroyed his home, killing his father and sister and severely injuring his mother. With the help of Specialist Azucena Roc\u00edo \u201cAmaru\u201d Quispe, C\u00e9sar\u2019s mother Sofia taught him to observe his surroundings, and to avoid the other boys his age who had been drawn into gang-related affairs. She encouraged him to enroll at the Heroic Naval Military School, where he graduated as a teniente de corbeta. He joined the Naval Infantry, then the Amphibious Commando Battalion, participating extensively in anti-smuggling operations and several high-profile arrests. Becoming a member of the Fuerzas Especiales introduced him to the reality that drugs were no longer the primary source of income for the cartels. He began working with UNESCO and INTERPOL to combat antiquities trafficking, where he gained the attention of Rainbow as a mind with a keen tactical sense and exceptional forward-thinking. Psychological report Specialist C\u00e9sar \"Goyo\" Ruiz Hern\u00e1ndez is a rare find. His jacket reads like any normal military trajectory, until you notice the devil behind the details. To confirm my theory, during our first meeting I challenged him to a game of chess. I won\u2019t mention how few moves it took him to beat me. C\u00e9sar himself seemed to think nothing of it. [\u2026] This humble attitude is at the heart of his character. His mother, Sofia \u2013 who protected him from the brunt of the bomb\u2019s blast \u2013 has cultivated an overtly optimistic worldview. Growing up where he did, when he did, she also instilled in him a cat-and-mouse mindset, to keep him clear of the negative influences that would have been especially tempting to a young fatherless boy with too much time on his hands. She was helped in this by Specialist Azucena Roc\u00edo \u201cAmaru\u201d Quispe, whose intermittent presence and strong familial values shored up a gap that Sofia alone couldn\u2019t fill. [\u2026] It\u2019s clear to me that Quispe, with her inherent attachment to her country and her family history, provided a stabilizing influence during Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s undoubtedly troubled adolescence. [\u2026] Hern\u00e1ndez is the kind to think carefully before speaking, a trait which can lead people to underestimate him. He is neither churlish nor aloof, but constantly considering the many angles of the problem set before him. [\u2026] His ability to track and guide his quarry, from determining their routine to understanding how they will react to threats, is uncanny. In a prosaic example, he brought Specialist Tina Lin \u201cFrost\u201d Tsang a bottle of apple-flavored soda on the first day of Fall, despite them only having met once before. She was unperturbed, but I could see that Hern\u00e1ndez had braced himself for a far less positive outcome. [\u2026] Specialist Hern\u00e1ndez has otherwise become a staple of our briefings, his incisive questions highlighting new tactical considerations or encouraging out-of-the-box thinking from the other members of the team. I must admit, it\u2019s refreshing to see what changes a new perspective and an impeccable poker face can bring to an otherwise very self-assured group of individuals. -- Dr. Harishva \"Harry\" Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}, "46": {"Side": "Defender", "Name": "warden", "Squad": "Ghosteyes", "Specialties": "ADGET,Intel", "HEALTH": 2, "Speed": 2, "Difficulty": 2, "Gadget": "Deployable Shield, Nitro Cell", "primary_weapon": "M590A1, SHOTGUN, MPX, SUBMACHINE GUN", "secondary_weapon": "P-10C, HANDGUN, SMG-12, Machine Pistol", "ability": "Glance Smart Glasses", "RealName": "Collinn McKinley", "DateofBirth": "March 18th (Age 48)", "PlaceofBirth": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Biography": "Biography \"I'm never unprepared.\" Collinn McKinley enrolled in the Marine Corps at 18 and earned several commendations in his service jacket for his aggressive quick-thinking, achieving Master Sergeant despite a few minor infractions on his record.

McKinley\u2019s agility was instrumental in saving Secretary of State Baldwin\u2019s life when insurgents attacked the U.S. diplomatic junket. Baldwin later went on to win the U.S. Presidential and requested McKinley be assigned to the Presidential Protective Division. McKinley has spent over a decade in Washington, protecting important political figures. He is the foremost expert in close protection detail, and with President Baldwin finishing his second term, McKinley has received high endorsements for his transition into Rainbow. Psychological report I\u2019ve learned to read between the lines, and when it comes to Specialist Collinn \"Warden\" McKinley, that\u2019s where the real story lies. His role as protector came easily to him between butting heads with his strict, hardworking father and defending his brothers at school, but it became more deeply engrained during his three tours with the Marines. McKinley\u2019s service with the Secret Service reads like a Washington gossip column/spy novel. During the attack on then Secretary-of-State Baldwin, the attackers used flashbangs, smoke grenades, and heavy suppressing fire to separate the protection detail. McKinley realized all their evacuation routes had been compromised and evacuated Baldwin alone. The incident clarified the reason behind McKinley\u2019s special glasses, but it\u2019s also become indicative of his modus operandi\u2026 his off-the-cuff attitude. He\u2019s never been wrong and I fear he\u2019ll rely on instinct until it finally fails him. His access to the inner circle through the Office of the President made him the go-to in handling delicate situations. He\u2019s clever enough to lead people on the right track without implicating himself and I suspect he knows where a few bodies are buried. McKinley has amassed quite the war chest of political favors and a reputation as a lady\u2019s man. President Baldwin once told me that McKinley\u2019s dalliances eclipsed that of some Presidential administrations. The First Lady was displeased with that joke. He knows how to manipulate; he deepens his Kentucky drawl when dealing with Republican senators, and plays the Southern gentleman around women. I was amused, watching him try to play to my personality\u2026 but I play the game too. McKinley adores his teams and he works well with others, but his connection to the Oval Office has instilled him with a sense of invulnerability. McKinley has made many enemies among politicians, businessmen, and Lobbyists; he\u2019s a walking encyclopedia of their sins, and President Baldwin won\u2019t be around to protect him anymore. He is the sort of non-traditional approach we need to keep the military and law enforcement more agile and surgical, someone who understands coordination on a large scale. Unfortunately, that means I owe President Baldwin a 25-year old single malt Scotch for recommending McKinley; he\u2019s insufferable when he\u2019s right. -- Dr. Harishva Pandey"}, "47": {"Side": "Defender", "Name": "mozzie", "Squad": "Ghosteyes", "Specialties": "ADGET,Intel", "HEALTH": 2, "Speed": 2, "Difficulty": 2, "Gadget": "Barbed Wire, Nitro Cell", "primary_weapon": "Commando 9, ASSAULT RIFLE, P10 RONI, SUBMACHINE GUN", "secondary_weapon": "SDP 9mm, HANDGUN", "ability": "Pest Launcher", "RealName": "Max Goose", "DateofBirth": "February 15th (Age 35)", "PlaceofBirth": "Portland, Australia", "Biography": "Biography \u201cC\u2019mon, I'm not here to fuck spiders.\u201d Right after Year 10, Max Goose applied to enter the Australian Defence Force Academy, later working in Combat & Security. He joined an infantry regiment that incorporated dirt bikes and all-terrain vehicles in their reconnaissance operations. Goose excelled in land navigation and became the two-wheeler expert in raids, scouting, and convoy operations. Following Operation Catalyst, he was handpicked to join the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR), so long as he passed selection and refrained from talking back. His specialized off-road skillsets and quick thinking were highly prized, even though his driving style appeared reckless. He deployed to Operation Slipper and served until the operation\u2019s conclusion. He later received the National Emergency Medal for saving firefighters during the Esperance bushfires. Goose is a calculated daredevil who loves testing upcoming military stealth bikes, but he says there\u2019s no bigger honor than being asked to join Rainbow Six. Psychological report On their own, Specialist Max \"Mozzie\" Goose and Specialist Tori \u201cGridlock\u201d Tallyo Fairous perform exceedingly well, but together, they pull off some amazing, even hare-brained stunts sure to make the sternest of commanders crack a smile\u2026 when they succeed, of course.

I\u2019m curious to see if they would still help each other as opponents, or if duty will take precedence over their friendship. [\u2026] He\u2019s a speed demon, not just on his bike, but how he processes information.

He jokes that his parents paid more attention to him the moment he engaged in extreme sports like freestyle mountain biking, dune buggy racing, and the occasional hang gliding.

He joined the GIGR (Royal Moroccan Gendarmerie) at 18, demonstrating natural leadership skills under fire. His ability to effectively command specialized squadrons in joint Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative (TSCTP) operations led to his promotion as Captain. After years of service, the Fortress\u2019 reigning Commander chose his successor: El Fassi, whose authoritative but ethical style made him a worthy \u201cKaid\u201d. His imposing presence and strict values led to success with his graduates, and the Fortress quickly gained accolades. He further proved its excellence through the thousands of soldiers who trained or taught on its grounds. Over years of negotiating, he welcomed troops from across Africa and the Middle-East, fostering stronger ties between TSCTP members and African Standby Force countries. Psychological report Specialist Jalal \u201cKaid\u201d El Fassi is an imposing Operator. His appearance alone inspires respect \u2013 it\u2019s easy to see why his stature and demeanor strike fear in his students. Or how his body language warrants their respect and cooperation without him having to say a word. Frankly, it\u2019s both daunting and fascinating at the same time. [\u2026] Specialist El Fassi descends from a long line of Commanders and their Fortress. The Fortress was in disrepute for quite some time, however \u2013 some business involving bribes from wealthy families \u2013 before El Fassi was at the helm. And it seems his administration not only eliminated these sordid dealings, but elevated the Fortress to heights unimagined by any of his predecessors. [\u2026] It\u2019s been difficult separating Specialist El Fassi from his role. He\u2019s sacrificed a personal life for the success of his Fortress, and his role makes it difficult to create interpersonal relationships. I suspect he prefers being alone\u2014he certainly isn\u2019t the type to open up and share, but I think I understand why. He\u2019s taken it upon himself to guide and nurture the future of Moroccan Special Forces, and potentially all of North Africa. He is the rock that all others look up to, so Specialist El Fassi shoulders the brunt of that weight with equanimity because he believes nobody else can. [\u2026] Specialist El Fassi is particularly phlegmatic, and his dedication to his duty as Commander and to the Fortress is resolute. Rainbow spent years trying to persuade him to join, but he is not easily moved. The Fortress and its legacy were instilled in him as a child. It is his home, his castle, and I can see the time he spends there in solitude is invaluable. But we finally managed to cut a deal with him, one that not even the great Kaid could turn down\u2026 one to improve his school and propel it into international standing.

She was relentless until the day her friend and mentor, Tray Pearson, died trying to stop looters during a riot. Two months later, Evans offered her assistance to the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) because she wanted to make a difference from within the system. The MPS offered her a clean slate if she helped stop protests from going violent. Evans made it her career, going from insider to eventually joining the MPS. During the 2011 London Riots, Police Constable Evans commanded the front line in the Territorial Support Group to stop the violence from spreading, and later acquired special permission to attend Gold Command meetings, devising new crowd-control strategies based on her years as riot leader.

She earned the Queen\u2019s Police Medal for exceptional bravery and earned a spot in Rainbow due to her experience, service record, and tenacity. Psychological report When I recommended Specialist Morowa \u201cClash\u201d Evans, I met considerable resistance. The Selection Board couldn\u2019t see past her violent past but I saw a street-hardened veteran who knew how to fight dirty and was the leading expert in riot control. [...] Despite the mistrust from her fellow Constables, Specialist Evans proved herself during the 2011 London Riots when she confronted those she once led; from the CCTV footage and eyewitness reports, those rioters showed her no mercy, but she was exemplary. I initially wondered what allowed her to switch sides and remain sane. It\u2019s because she was still protecting Londoners from racists and those rioters alike who were indiscriminately hurting locals. She didn\u2019t want to quiet the storm. She wanted to redirect it. Regardless, it wasn\u2019t easy going from riot leader to gaining Scotland Yard\u2019s trust. I\u2019d say it\u2019s the very definition of an uphill battle and I know for a fact that every misstep was used against her. Her temper got the better of her early on, and some officers went out of their way to provoke her. In the end, many bets were lost when she graduated from Hendon, but she rightfully earned her division\u2019s respect.

He joined the Carabinieri and earned a spot as an Explorer Paratrooper in the 1st Paratrooper Regiment known as Tuscania. After several distinguished tours where he earned Silver and Bronze Medals of Military Valor, Martello qualified for Gruppo di Intervento Speciale (Special Intervention Group or G.I.S.) and participated in joint operations in Iraq, earning a facial scar from a roadside IED. He engaged in multiple actions against homegrown threats in Italy and eventually became an instructor helping train Tier 3 units in the Italian military. After Martello\u2019s tour was completed, he went into private consultation where his courses quickly became a top-rated operator bootcamp for teaching advanced techniques to Tier 3 and Tier 2 units, as well as private military companies. The Tuscania eventually convinced Martello to re-enlist to help upgrade one of their units to a Tier 2 Special Forces classification, and this enabled him to join Rainbow as a representative of the Italian Units. Psychological report I have no doubt that Specialist Adriano Martello (AKA: Maestro) is a natural leader. He had earned the nickname Maestro due to his willingness to sacrifice first place in order to help other soldiers during basic training, and while records indicate that some soldiers didn\u2019t appreciate the handholding, I think it refined Specialist Martello\u2019s teaching methodology. [...] I did review his school records in regards to the fights he got into, and I believe he was keeping his brothers and sisters out of trouble by fighting for them. [...] He initially entered the military to ease his parents\u2019 financial burden in raising eight children and he carries that sense of responsibility into his units. He cares about the men and women he serves with and has an affinity for bringing out the best in others, even if it\u2019s with a bit of good-natured bluster and perhaps more vulgarity than some of our more reserved operators are used to. I suspect Specialist Martello enjoys cussing for effect though there is no doubt that he teaches through anecdotes. He presents himself as genuine, however, and it\u2019s an undeniable part of his charm because it comes off without any sort of duplicity. [...] Specialist Martello will make an excellent Tactical Control Commander one day, but his biggest liability is his own wanderlust. [...] He loves pursuing challenges to his own detriment. Once he\u2019s conquered an objective, there\u2019s little keeping him rooted. He has personal ties with Specialist Seamus \"Sledge\" Cowden (Joint Operations in Iraq before Article 5 was instituted), enough that to my understanding he\u2019s invited Specialist Cowden over to visit his family when the pair were cycled off duty rotation. Even then, I doubt it\u2019s enough to keep him tied to Rainbow Operations. His ties to Specialist Aria \"Alibi\" de Luca may be a different story, however. They worked closely together during Operation Spider Wasp, with Specialist Martello\u2019s unit taking down organized crime targets based on Specialist de Luca\u2019s intel. Whatever other history they share remains unknown to me\u2026 for now. [...] It is my estimation that Specialist Martello needs a carrot to remain invested, and that means presenting him with challenges that he\u2019s likely to fail at. It\u2019s why I recommend Specialist Martello step into the boxing ring with Specialist James \"Smoke\" Porter, for example, and pit him against a boxer with more training and skill. From my records, Specialist Martello grew up in the lower income neighborhoods along Rome\u2019s Lungotevere, where he befriended local Romany children. He boasts about boxing with the Romany, a strong tradition in that culture, and I believe that training him with Porter will encourage positive memories that will link his childhood with Rainbow. [...] Another option is to arrange for Specialist Mike \"Thatcher\" Baker to take a personal interest in Martello\u2019s development. Martello has nothing short of genuine respect for Specialist Baker, enough to leave him tongue-tied around the SAS veteran. That state of deference may forge a strong enough bond to keep Specialist Martello invested in the Rainbow program. -- Dr. Harishva Pandey"}, "51": {"Side": "Defender", "Name": "alibi", "Squad": "Viperstrike", "Specialties": "TRAPPER", "HEALTH": 1, "Speed": 3, "Difficulty": 3, "Gadget": "Impact Grenade, Deployable Shield", "primary_weapon": "Mx4 Storm, SUBMACHINE GUN, ACS12, SHOTGUN", "secondary_weapon": "Keratos .357, HANDGUN, Bailiff 410, HANDGUN", "ability": "Prisma", "RealName": "Aria de Luca", "DateofBirth": "December 15th (Age 37)", "PlaceofBirth": "Tripoli, Libya", "Biography": "Biography \u201cNever reveal the cards you were dealt.\u201d Aria \"Alibi\" de Luca was born in Tripoli, Libya and immigrated with her family when she was three years old.

De Luca earned her understanding and usage of Italian firearms through the family business and training on the shooting range. At 18, Aria entered the European Championships organized by the European Shooting Confederation, and won gold in both the 10-metre running target and 10-metre air pistol divisions. Following the event, a Carabinieri recruiter convinced her to join the police force. De Luca\u2019s precision shooting skills and professionalism shot her up the ranks quickly, and she served for a time with the elite Raggruppamento Operativo Speciale in fighting organized crime. She eventually earned a spot in the prestigious Gruppo Intervento Speciale (G.I.S.), and following a successful operation in Afghanistan despite being separated from her unit, she was singled out for undercover work in organized crime. She infiltrated the Vinciguerra Crime Family as an arms dealer and spent several years among them before bringing them down from the inside. A newspaper leak of impending operations against the Vinciguerras then forced the G.I.S. to accelerate their initiative. Following her undercover work and the successful dismantling of the Vinciguerra Crime Family, Aria de Luca received the invitation to join Rainbow as a capable operator.

[\u2026] She carries a deep-seated hatred for crime families (that much is obvious--it\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve come to seeing her sophisticated veneer crack) and I think it may compromise her ability to operate rationally when it comes to organized crime.

Cross analyzing that with old police records and her family\u2019s hospital visits, I believe her father was the victim of pizzo or a protection racket\u2026 unless de Luca Sr. was singularly unlucky enough to repeatedly break fingers, fall down stairs, and break his own arm\u2026 twice. Specialist De Luca was never herself injured, and shows the same strong constitution and mental fortitude that we come to expect from all our operators. Psychologically, however, the wounds are deep and I suspect that her father\u2019s brush with organized crime has set our \u201cAlibi\u201d on her path. [\u2026] Alibi as a codename is also rather telling, considering the circumstances that cut short her undercover operation against the Vinciguerra crime family. On paper, Specialist de Luca is a decorated hero of the G.I.S. with a Gold Medal for Civil Valor for her efforts, but if you dig a little, she has her detractors who believe she was the source of the leak that nearly sabotaged the G.I.S. investigation. [\u2026] Specialist de Luca was enjoying a meteoric rise within the Vinciguerra crime family as an arms dealer when she gained access to a compound outside of Genoa that was central to the Vinciguerra's human trafficking operations. As a naturalized immigrant herself, it would seem that when Specialist de Luca saw the dozens of refugees waiting to be sold into slave labor and prostitution at the hands of the Vinciguerras, it broke through her well-crafted defenses and compelled her to act. [\u2026] I know for a fact that she tried to convince her superiors to raid the Genoa compound and that they refused because they were still gathering intel. I know that the reporter who cited a confidential informant in his expos\u00e9 on the Genoa compound received his intel in the days following Specialist de Luca\u2019s meeting with her bosses.[\u2026] I\u2019ll state this for the record\u2026 if Specialist de Luca did leak the information to spur the G.I.S. into action and to save those lives in Genoa, then I am somewhat relieved. It proves that there are lines Specialist de Luca will not cross, and this may prove important. I suspect that Under-Secretary-General Barston used backchannels to put Specialist de Luca\u2019s service jacket on my desk, and that he isn\u2019t a supporter of the Rainbow Program. Whatever he hopes to gain with this maneuver, I can state with no modest degree of certainty that Specialist de Luca remains unaware of this political agenda. But she likely has a part to play in whatever Under-Secretary-General Barston may have planned. [\u2026] If we want to get her on our side of things then Specialist (Maestro) Martello\u2019s inclusion in Rainbow serves us for both his skills and his ability to get past Specialist de Luca\u2019s walls. They worked extensively together during the Vinciguerra operations. She provided the intel and his unit acted on it. I suspect their relationship may be closer than that, but there appears to be a level of volatility that bears closer watch. Are they close friends? Are they familial? Or something else? Time will tell. Fortunately, Specialist de Luca seems to fit in well, foregoing the hazing that both the S.A.S. and SEALS operators seem fond of inflicting [\u2026]. In conclusion, I believe Specialist de Luca is a valuable addition to the Rainbow Program and that her particular skills will keep the teams guessing during asymmetrical combat simulations. -- Dr. Harishva Pandey"}, "52": {"Side": "Defender", "Name": "vigil", "Squad": "Ghosteyes", "Specialties": "ADGET,CROWD CONTROL", "HEALTH": 1, "Speed": 3, "Difficulty": 3, "Gadget": "Bulletproof camera, Impact Grenade", "primary_weapon": "K1A, SUBMACHINE GUN, BOSG.12.2, SHOTGUN", "secondary_weapon": "C75 Auto, Machine Pistol, SMG-12, Machine Pistol", "ability": "ERC-7", "RealName": "Chul Kyung Hwa", "DateofBirth": "January 17th (Age 34)", "PlaceofBirth": "[REDACTED]", "Biography": "Biography \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I was never here.\u201d Much of Hwa\u2019s early records are unclear. His birth parents remain unknown. What is known is that he suffered the loss of his older brother and father in their bid to reach the Republic of Korea. School records track him from late adolescence, when he was adopted into the Hwa family. Initial reports indicate signs of early trauma \u2013 reclusive, slow reader \u2013 however, his later grades show great improvement and focus. Hwa gravitated toward electronics and electrical engineering. Wanting to use his talents and demonstrate pride for his country, he chose to join the ROK Navy. He later earned a berth in the ROKN UDT/SEALs, with a knack for radar systems and stealth technology. Handpicked by the respected 707th Special Mission Battalion for unconventional warfare missions, he proved to be quick and lethal. Hwa served together with Specialist Grace \u201cDokkaebi\u201d Nam until their recruitment into Rainbow. Psychological report Specialist Chul Kyung \u201cVigil\u201d Hwa had a tumultuous childhood. Much of it is lost to him, and what he remembers is precious. I assured him that my role isn\u2019t to pick apart his past or dredge up events that would unsettle him, though of course I\u2019m always here should he or any of our operators need me. I explained that my role is to shape a cohesive team \u2013 everyone fits in some way, and it\u2019s up to me to piece it all together. [\u2026] Preservation of anonymity drives everything Hwa does. He\u2019s uncomfortable with me recording our conversations, and that a notification on my phone revealed our meeting time. He\u2019s equally anxious in social situations. It\u2019s difficult to tell if he has a strong self-concept or an utter lack of one. What is apparent is that Hwa can\u2019t let anyone in, which means he\u2019s often trapped alone with his own thoughts. [\u2026] I wanted him to have a clear picture of who he was, at that moment, in my office. To see himself not just as an elite operator or a small child who lost his family. So I suppose he may not have understood where I was going when I asked if he liked Saturday morning cartoons. We ran through a casual series of likes and dislikes ranging from quiet contemplation to free association. He was uncomfortable, but he humored me. As he relaxed, some of his own answers caught him off guard. From discussing breakfast cereals and the realization that he doesn\u2019t know how to ride a bike, he was able to relate a memory to me. He described how the scent of hot soup triggered a vivid image \u2013 a woman, who he assumed was his mother, smiling and handing him a bowl. His face softened, and for a moment, he was home. [\u2026] I\u2019ve encouraged Hwa to carry on these associative exercises throughout his day.

Like her sister, Zofia, Ela excelled in the grueling training imposed upon them by their father. She attended officers\u2019 school but couldn\u2019t reconcile military life with her need for independence and left to study Fine Arts in Berlin. Her reputation for using military paraphernalia in her art attracted the owner of a small private security company, who offered her a job. She was valued in the private sector for her expertise in survivalist tactics and unique adaptive style during protective detail and intelligence gathering, until her father\u2019s death convinced her to return to Poland and join GROM. Ela is a reliable team player with leadership potential, even if her distrust of authority continues to be a point of contention. Her successful collaboration with SEAL prompted her invitation to join Rainbow. Psychological report We civilians can understand Specialist El\u017cbieta \u201cEla\u201d Bosak\u2019s independent nature more than some starch-collared military commander might. Of course, following orders is expected of those within the rank-and-file, and for someone so quick to buck against authority she also expresses a deep respect for the military and her role within it. It\u2019s her autonomy that rubs traditionalists the wrong way, and perhaps her anger. Even at our first meeting, I detected her resolve. She is fighting against something, but it may not be authority \u2013 at least not entirely. [\u2026] I won\u2019t dismiss the concerns of commanding officers who mention that Bosak can be impulsive, but I would urge them instead to appreciate her creative resilience. Anyone who has worked with artists can attest to this quality. It manifests in the field in the protection of her team and her high number of successful operations. Her impulsiveness \u2013 her adaptability \u2013 is the very quality that causes her to excel. [\u2026] Both Ela and her sister, Zofia, carry the deep impression of their father\u2019s influence. Ela is more inclined to accept that her father, though exceptional, wasn\u2019t perfect. In reviewing Commander Jan Bosak\u2019s file, I saw a proud, insightful man. That\u2019s the key. Ela is finely tuned to the patterns and behaviors around her and when she seems defiant it\u2019s because she\u2019s frustrated with those who lack this \u201cvision.\u201d Joining Rainbow, and working with other elite operators, has somewhat tempered this frustration as she no longer feels constrained by the attitudes of those around her. [\u2026] Ela\u2019s defiance extends into her personal life. She isn\u2019t interested in self-improvement, she told me. She was surprised when I said I know about her \u201cvolunteer work.\u201d She roams the streets late at night, with food and blankets to hand out, or even just a cigarette. Then she listens. Her conversations with strangers offer fresh perspectives. She stockpiles them, to add to her insight and therefore her skills, but also as fuel for her work.

Only the weak-minded will demand you make yourself smaller.\u201d Born and raised in Tseung Kwan O (Junk Bay), Liu\u2019s early years were spent working alongside his father in the shipyards, stripping obsolete tankers for raw materials and parts. Growing up surrounded by hazardous materials and seeing their long-term effects on his fellow workers left Liu with an abiding respect for toxins and their effect on the human body. Initially seeking additional income, he volunteered for mine clearing duties in Yunnan and Guangxi provinces where his abilities and bravery caught the attention of key personnel within the Hong Kong Police Department. Liu then joined the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Bureau (EOD), giving him the opportunity to continue his chemistry and forensics-based education along with intense on-site training. Liu\u2019s expertise with chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats made him a clear first pick during the formation of Rainbow\u2019s CBRN unit. Liu continues to volunteer for mine clearing duty in his spare time. Psychological report Specialist Liu \u201cLesion\u201d Tze Long\u2019s teammates have a great deal of respect for him, despite the fact that he can often drop off the radar due to his low-key style. Liu doesn\u2019t mind that he\u2019s overlooked; in fact, when I suggested this to him it prompted a smile. While on an operation, Liu is intense and focused, and thinks quickly on his feet. In his downtime he is soft-spoken with a wonderful dry wit. His family\u2019s poverty encouraged him to be philosophical about his childhood. Even now he prefers to keep life simple by spending his money and time on things that have purpose. Liu told me he isn\u2019t a person who rails against things beyond his control, and I know from observation that he isn\u2019t someone who counts his scars. [\u2026] His childhood, frankly, sounds horrific. His health was at risk from toxic materials, not to mention the physical danger of ripping apart tonnes of steel. And yet Liu remembers his past fondly, regarding the bad moments as something he was lucky enough to survive. I wondered if his optimism was a survival mechanism to weather horrifying circumstances, but Liu was eager to put me at ease. It wasn\u2019t all bad, he said. He described how he and his father would admire the sunrise dancing across the water and take long lunch breaks to go fishing. [\u2026] Liu continues to live close to where he grew up. His connection to the location is more than nostalgia. There\u2019s a sense of satisfaction in knowing what it used to be and how time has affected it. Liu says both he and Junk Bay have changed for the better, and that the future can always be shaped into something good. As he did at the start of his career, Liu still volunteers in underprivileged areas. His expertise has contributed to the clearing of tens of thousands of mines and unexploded ordnance. In particular, he\u2019s been consulting the tech experts within Rainbow as he and operators Olivier \u201cLion\u201d Flament and Lera \u201cFinka\u201d Melnikova look to incorporate state-of-the-art solutions into their CBRN threat unit. -- Dr. Harishva \u201cHarry\u201d Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}, "55": {"Side": "Defender", "Name": "mira", "Squad": "Viperstrike", "Specialties": "SUPPORT", "HEALTH": 3, "Speed": 1, "Difficulty": 3, "Gadget": "PROXIMITY ALARM, Nitro Cell", "primary_weapon": "Vector .45 ACP, SUBMACHINE GUN, ITA12L, SHOTGUN", "secondary_weapon": "USP40, HANDGUN, ITA12S, SHOTGUN", "ability": "Black mirror", "RealName": "Elena Mar\u00eda \u00c1lvarez", "DateofBirth": "November 18th (Age 39)", "PlaceofBirth": "Madrid, Spain", "Biography": "Biography \u201cThink of me as your conscience.

Instilled with a strong sense of justice and an obligation to serve, \u00c1lvarez joined the Cuerpo Nacional de Polic\u00eda. She saw the need for better equipment and developed new bulletproof materials to protect her teammates while on operations. Encouraged to join the Grupo Especial de Operaciones, she beat more than 100 other recruits for the coveted position. The reinforced armor she wears is her design. \u00c1lvarez was hired as Rainbow\u2019s Director of Research and Development before being added to the combat roster so that she could better test her developments and improvements under field conditions. She flies helicopters in her spare time. Psychological report Specialist Elena Mar\u00eda \u201cMira\u201d \u00c1lvarez thinks on her feet. Someone this adaptable and versatile is difficult to predict\u2026 as they should be. She takes risks, though, and I\u2019m hoping they\u2019re calculated ones. \u00c1lvarez is one of the operators who most strives to be a hero. Ferociously protective of teammates and those she considers friends, she can nonetheless dominate an operation, forcing others to blend their tactics with hers if they wish to succeed. [\u2026] \u00c1lvarez enjoys her time in the lab and I\u2019m grateful she accepted my offer to become head of R&D. Working surrounded by machinery reminds her of her father and the strong bond they continue to share. [\u2026] As far back as she can recall it was only ever the two of them, though her father\u2019s shared memories of her grandmother gave her a second role model to look up to. One story stands out in particular: While working late in his garage, her father was pinned under a car. \u00c1lvarez found him. She was seven years old. Refusing to leave him, she struggled with the heavy jack \u2013 despite his protests \u2013 and got him free. Only then did she run for help. [\u2026] This is the loyalty and stubbornness that I see in her, and that her team appreciates. It comes from a kind heart. [\u2026] When not working, \u00c1lvarez is restless, which she\u2019s managed to channel into her art. Her metal sculptures are a source of great pride and she showed me photos of her portfolio. The way she incorporates used machine parts and ballistic glass is enchanting. [\u2026] \u00c1lvarez uses her artistic sensibilities to visualize scenarios with unique clarity. The team should be encouraged to make better use of his talent. [\u2026] Her ongoing rivalry with Specialist Eliza \u201cAsh\u201d Cohen is a clash of two strong-willed people. Both have solid leadership skills and both care about their teams. They simply approach challenges differently. We need to work through some scenarios where they can both apply their strengths to reach an acceptable outcome. Only through joint success will they see the value of each other\u2019s approaches. -- Dr. Harishva \u201cHarry\u201d Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}, "56": {"Side": "Defender", "Name": "echo", "Squad": "Viperstrike", "Specialties": "CROWD CONTROL", "HEALTH": 2, "Speed": 2, "Difficulty": 3, "Gadget": "Impact Grenade, Deployable Shield", "primary_weapon": "MP5SD, SUBMACHINE GUN, SuperNova, SHOTGUN", "secondary_weapon": "P229, HANDGUN, Bearing 9, Machine Pistol", "ability": "Yokai", "RealName": "Masaru Enatsu", "DateofBirth": "October 31st (Age 36)", "PlaceofBirth": "Tokyo, Japan (Suginami-ku)", "Biography": "Biography \u201cDon\u2019t ask me what I\u2019m doing on my phone.

Fascinated with robotics from an early age, he designed and programmed both terrestrial and flying drones and went on to win numerous competitions. After studying Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Tokyo Metropolitan University, Enatsu was encouraged to join the National Police Agency Security Bureau where he worked tirelessly in their research and development lab. Trained in counter-terrorism and intelligence gathering, Enatsu began designing specific tech that would better aid the Bureau. Joint training after the Nagoya hostage crisis prompted Enatsu to transfer to the Aichi Prefectural Police Department Special Unit where his tenacious focus enabled him to find creative solutions and alternate strategies. He eventually returned to Tokyo, where his exceptional intel gathering techniques as well as his quick and unpredictable methodology caught the attention of Rainbow. Psychological report To say that Specialist Masaru \u201cEcho\u201d Enatsu\u2019s file has a few flags regarding his conduct is an understatement. Prior to our first session together I had met with every other member of Rainbow \u2013 some more than once. So when the conversation began with Enatsu admitting he\u2019d been avoiding me, I knew we were going to get along. Often, I would rather not read a file first, to give someone a chance to tell me who they are in their own words. In this case it was important that I know what people think, because Enatsu was braced for my reaction. [\u2026] I gather he and his family aren\u2019t close. He joked that a calculator has more emotional range than his parents. This upbringing has made him resistant to working in groups, because a friendly, mutually beneficial dynamic isn\u2019t one he\u2019s familiar with. It\u2019s my hope his time with Rainbow will help, but his desire to explore the \u201cAI\u201d of his fellow operators by pushing their buttons is something that may need to be handled from within the group. [\u2026] Enatsu\u2019s tactics have been described as tricky and unpredictable. This can work as a strong team strategy but it demands communication. [\u2026] I\u2019d also encourage the team to think of how best to utilize Enatsu\u2019s potential. Some operators assume there will be issues with him before they even begin, which leads to predictable results. [\u2026] Specialists Yumiko \u201cHibana\u201d Imagawa and Grace \u201cDokkaebi\u201d Nam work with Enatsu on R&D quite often, actually. I\u2019ve also noticed that he\u2019s developed a rapport with Specialist Taina \u201cCaveira\u201d Pereira. I suspect he appreciates Pereira\u2019s candor, since it ties into his own assumption that people who are offended simply don\u2019t \u201cget the joke.\u201d [\u2026] Enatsu frustrates easily. He has few outside interests, and consequently thinks only about improving his operational efficiency. It\u2019s important that he recognize that everyone needs diversions \u2013 those in high-stress jobs even more so. It isn\u2019t a sign of weakness to \u201cswitch off\u201d every now and again, even if he has been conditioned to believe that a restful mind indicates a lack of intelligence. -- Dr. Harishva \u201cHarry\u201d Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}, "57": {"Side": "Defender", "Name": "caveira", "Squad": "Ghosteyes", "Specialties": "CROWD CONTROL", "HEALTH": 1, "Speed": 3, "Difficulty": 3, "Gadget": "PROXIMITY ALARM, Impact Grenade", "primary_weapon": "M12, SUBMACHINE GUN, SPAS-15, SHOTGUN", "secondary_weapon": "Luison", "ability": "Silent Step", "RealName": "Taina Pereira", "DateofBirth": "October 15th (Age 27)", "PlaceofBirth": "Rin\u00f3polis, Brazil", "Biography": "Biography \u201cNot every child gets to choose who they grow up to be.\u201d Pereira is seventh of ten kids, born to a widowed mother in a small town of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. After moving to Rio de Janeiro at a young age, Pereira was arrested for robbery and offered a choice between juvenile reformatory and working with the Pol\u00edcia Militar as an informant. Years of undercover operations within Brazil\u2019s notorious gangs made her a master of interrogation techniques and surveillance, and Pereira is now frequently called upon to conduct training exercises within the force. Her skills in confined environment tactics, extraction, and extreme risk situations are exemplary. It was Pereira\u2019s actions during the Rio de Janeiro Security Crisis that caught the attention of Rainbow, though multiple reports note that she is considered a dangerous, free-roaming operator.  Outside of her professional record, little is known of Pereira\u2019s life, except that she enjoys learning different languages and fighting in unofficial Jiu Jitsu tournaments. Psychological report It\u2019s too obvious to describe Specialist Taina \u201cCaveira\u201d Pereira as fearless and intelligent when a slew of reports describe how daring she is on operations; how she isn\u2019t one to ruminate before she reacts; that she\u2019s about getting the job done. And while her successes haven\u2019t gone unnoticed, she\u2019s been denied commendations due to her rebellious nature. With all that, on our first meeting I was expecting \u2013 who was I expecting? [\u2026] Starting her military career as an informant tells me she\u2019s a survivor. In that context, it made more sense to ask why she continued once her mandatory sentence had ended. She told me it went from being a way out to being a way of life. She\u2019s still defiant, up against the system. But it\u2019s also clear, even as she teases others about their \u201csuperhero sense of justice,\u201d that she takes her role seriously. [\u2026] Pereira is often criticized for being blunt by those who don\u2019t understand large family dynamics \u2013 particularly with so many brothers. Though very close with her siblings, Pereira had to fight to be heard or even noticed. It\u2019s understandable that she treasures privacy, and exudes great satisfaction with having her own way. At the same time, her family dynamics made her comfortable with noise and spontaneity, and she understands the subtleties of group dynamics far better than others her age. It\u2019s one of the reasons she\u2019s so skilled with interrogation. I do hate to imagine how the streets may have sharpened that skill, though. [\u2026] Pereira has made it clear we won\u2019t be discussing her private life. By the way she played with her necklace, I think she was protecting someone close rather than slighting me. [\u2026] So, who was I expecting when I met Specialist Pereira? She isn\u2019t someone who can be anticipated or predicted. That\u2019s not an ominous warning. Quite the opposite. I have utmost faith in her abilities, in her poise and inner focus. Where others see rebellion, I see resourcefulness.

Her father was a respected Colonel in the Marine Corps, her mother a researcher at a nearby biotech company. From an early age, she was known as a high achiever in math and science and as an athletic prodigy. An Olympic hopeful in swimming, Castellano broke her arm in a car accident when she was 16, putting an end to her career. She changed her focus and enlisted in the Navy, while also attending university. After graduating with a degree in Computer Science, specializing in Security and Cryptography, she transferred to the Information Dominance Corps. Castellano\u2019s attention to detail and analytical skill made her one of their most sought-after specialists. She applied to become a SEAL when the position was opened to women and succeeded after several grueling years, acting as encouragement for others to follow. Psychological report At the start of my first meeting with Specialist Meghan \u201cValkyrie\u201d Castellano she struck me as someone who ticks all the boxes \u2013 someone who meets or exceeds expectations. Someone impeccable. But looking at the field reports I see someone aggressive, someone willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish the mission. This contrast interests me. [\u2026] How Castellano views her role is more complicated than her initial polite response would indicate. While we\u2019ve raised the bar for her and she appreciates the challenge, I can tell she\u2019s struggling with something. [\u2026] Castellano isn\u2019t used to being around so many high-achievers. She\u2019s always been at the top of the class \u2013 the go-to person. The only other time that she felt \u201cagainst the wall,\u201d as she put it, was during SEAL training. Normally I\u2019d encourage her to interact with someone who can understand what she went through, another SEAL such as Specialist Craig \u201cBlackbeard\u201d Jenson, but I know he was one of the instructors during her Hell Week and while she respects him, I don\u2019t detect any great fondness there, either. [\u2026] Castellano is currently enrolled for a helicopter pilot license, inspired by Specialist Elena Mar\u00eda \u201cMira\u201d \u00c1lvarez, and language classes inspired by Specialists Yumiko \u201cHibana\u201d Imagawa and Miles \u201cCastle\u201d Campbell. [\u2026] The intimidation she feels at being surrounded by other exceptional minds is resulting in undue pressure. Self-improvement is fine if it\u2019s for the right reasons. Castellano is already a valuable operator, despite mounting tensions with Specialist Taina \u201cCaveira\u201d Pereira over the incident in Bolivia. I want Castellano to invest in a healthier view of what it means to be in a team. [\u2026] Beyond her deployments, Castellano doesn\u2019t travel. Vacation is home near the sand and surf. This hermit lifestyle doesn\u2019t entirely seem like it\u2019s her natural state of being. The intense pressure she\u2019s putting on herself needs some sort of\u2026 fulcrum.

At the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC), she graduated top of her class. Upon completion of her bachelor\u2019s degree and officer training, Tsang was stationed on Canada\u2019s west coast at CFB Esquimalt with the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Victoria (JRCC Victoria). From there she served on the primary Search & Rescue response team covering BC and the Yukon Territory. Tsang has been praised for exceptional situational awareness and is valued for her mission planning and threat reaction. Her SAR training in mountain-climbing, parachuting and diving extends into her recreational time. Drawing on her background in Mechanical Engineering, Tsang helped design and modify the Sterling Mk2 LHT, or \u201cWelcome Mat,\u201d whose portable design allows for discreet deployment in a variety of areas and environments. Psychological report I confess I find Tina Lin \u201cFrost\u201d Tsang\u2019s energy exhausting. Not many adults make me feel like an old man. She rearranged my shelves during our meeting\u2026 It does look better. Not that Tsang is nervous. Far from it. It\u2019s more akin to a fine-tuned athlete. [\u2026] Field reports highlight Tsang\u2019s focus and perseverance. The team trusts her planning, if not necessarily her fastidiousness. Any disagreements don\u2019t appear to hinder the team dynamic since Tsang is open to feedback, though I do detect some resentment from her concerning people who might be less patient or who opt for shortcuts. [\u2026] Tsang\u2019s mission planning is meticulous and she brings this same careful viewpoint to her everyday life. A good example was when she told me about her parents\u2019 recent anniversary party. She described the traditional Chinese banquet and its ten-course meal in such detail, I think she could recreate it from memory. [\u2026] Beyond that, it was a challenge finding a subject outside of operations that excites her. Music? Depends on her mood. Books? Not really. Finally, I asked about her hunting trips. Growing up in British Columbia, Tsang developed a respect for Canada\u2019s indigenous cultures and urged me to visit Haida Gwaii territory should I visit West Coast Canada. When I asked about the vague note in her medical records regarding a hunting accident, she was reluctant to talk. Her bush plane made an emergency landing in a range called the Nahanni. Bad weather rolled in and then, a week later, help arrived. Her reluctance to offer details and frequent use of \u201cshould have\u201d indicate she feels some shame. Rather than push the issue, I introduced her to Specialist Sanaa \u201cNomad\u201d El Maktoub. Their similar experiences made them instant friends. Both women share a deep connection to the outdoors. It\u2019s not simply being outside -- it\u2019s the wild that appeals. [\u2026] Tsang\u2019s precision-oriented personality is a huge asset, but I\u2019d like her to consider deeper introspection. Her ability to self-actualize will be critical if we continue to have her working alongside other strong personalities such as Specialist Taina \u201cCaveira\u201d Pereira. -- Dr. Harishva \u201cHarry\u201d Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}, "60": {"Side": "Defender", "Name": "mute", "Squad": "Viperstrike", "Specialties": "ADGET,CROWD CONTROL", "HEALTH": 3, "Speed": 1, "Difficulty": 1, "Gadget": "Bulletproof camera, Nitro Cell", "primary_weapon": "MP5K, SUBMACHINE GUN, M590A1, SHOTGUN", "secondary_weapon": "P226 Mk 25, HANDGUN, SMG-11, Machine Pistol", "ability": "Signal Disruptor", "RealName": "Mark R.

He majored in electronics and computer engineering, completing an internship at a prestigious tech company where he contributed to the design and function of security system prototypes. His ingenuity caught the attention of Britain\u2019s national security office, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). Having demonstrated acuity in code breaking, Chandar became an intelligence officer within the signals intelligence (SIGINT) unit. He continues to contribute to the applied technical research team and has recently expanded his field of study to include learning Korean. Psychological report It may not be immediately clear why Specialist Mark Chandar\u2019s codename is Mute. While he dislikes small talk, he isn\u2019t particularly reserved and in fact can be brash \u2013 a trait that is off-putting to some. Whatever social agitation he experiences, there are some indications that he\u2019s unable to shake it off. I suspect it\u2019s because he\u2019s impatient. He needs to appreciate that there are different approaches to solving a problem. Interestingly, Specialist Mike \u201cThatcher\u201d Baker seems begrudgingly tolerant of him and has been known to speak up in Chandar\u2019s defense. [\u2026] Chandar tends to gravitate to certain personalities. In particular, I\u2019ve noticed that he\u2019s been interacting with Specialist Timur \u201cGlaz\u201d Glazkov lately. Because Chandar revels in deconstructing equipment to create something new, I think he\u2019s drawn to abstract thinkers and Glazkov has a similar talent for seeing complex situations in a unique way. [\u2026] Given his background in information security, Chandar understands secrecy and seems uncomfortable with expressing himself or with personal questions. In his field, and here at Rainbow, information is a critical \u2013 life and death \u2013 commodity. So of course, I respect this but only up to a limit. I had to find another way in and we managed to find common ground in discussing History, of all things! For someone so focused on science he surprised me. His hometown of York is one of the most historic cities in England and it\u2019s a city I adore. He described in wonderful detail how he had to pass the Gothic church on his walk to school. He liked to lean back and look up at the bell tower for so long that it made him wobbly. [\u2026] My meeting with Chandar reminded me that we here at Rainbow tend to focus on how our operators excel in the STEM fields, but there is great value in our operators having passion and interests across a broad spectrum of studies. Chandar demonstrates why he\u2019s much more than someone who is used to being the smartest person in the room.

Immediately around me, anyway.\u201d Though Porter wasn\u2019t an exceptional student, aptitude tests revealed his propensity for sciences. Encouraged by faculty and his parents, he was able to follow a more unorthodox manner of education with tutors, home-schooling, and field science. He flourished in this break from formal classroom studies and quickly developed his skills in chemistry, biology, and math. Uninterested in pursuing a formal university education, Porter forged a fake ID and enlisted in the British Army. Though the rigidity of army rules wasn\u2019t always a good fit, it was offset by the diverse range of training and experiences army life gave him. While he has been reprimanded for breaking rules, his superiors quickly recognized both his innovation and strategic perspective. He was then encouraged to join the SAS. Porter prefers to acquire knowledge and skills, such as language and music, in his own way and does not excel in a formal training capacity. Psychological report It\u2019s important for me to not have any preconceived expectations before a face-to-face with any specialist. Since assessments of Specialist James \u201cSmoke\u201d Porter contain some contradictions, I couldn\u2019t have settled into any viewpoint anyway. So essentially he entered my office as somewhat of a mystery. [\u2026] Porter is consistently described as detached.  I reviewed his files and found that his \u201caloofness\u201d occurs during high-intensity situations. It\u2019s likely not detachment, but focus. I\u2019m reminded of my uncle who used to tap his forehead and tell me to master my mind. Porter, I think, is mastering his mind to stay on task and filter out dangerous distractions. He strives to keep emotions away from decision-making, opting for outlets such as live music events to deplete the tension, thus enabling him to be the person he needs to be on the job. [\u2026] It\u2019s clear that Porter\u2019s parents encouraged him to be a free spirit and develop his education and personality on his own terms. While it resulted in some unfortunate mishaps \u2013 one science experiment left some physical scars but no emotional ones that I can see \u2013 there was great benefit in it. [\u2026] Porter\u2019s free range education helped create a complex, dynamic person who isn\u2019t easily categorized. Porter is popular among his teammates and considered valuable despite some recklessness. Descriptions such as thrill-seeker and fearless seem simplistic to me, however. There\u2019s more nuance to Porter than that. He\u2019s measured and understands calculated risks. Porter \u2013 and our other operators \u2013 understand that it\u2019s more important to respect fear than to try to pretend we never feel it. [\u2026] Self-taught from an early age, Porter continues to spend time cultivating his own identity. He enjoys acquiring experiences and once he\u2019s mastered them, moves on. The exception is his adopted daughter. He would only share one photo of her. I\u2019ve never seen an infant surrounded by so much dangerous paraphernalia, but Porter assures me she is now in high school, excelling within the system he himself was unable to comprehend. Through her, he sees the world in new ways \u2013 exactly the kind of challenge he adores. -- Dr. Harishva \"Harry\" Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}, "62": {"Side": "Defender", "Name": "castle", "Squad": "Wolfguard", "Specialties": "NTRY,SUPPORT", "HEALTH": 2, "Speed": 2, "Difficulty": 2, "Gadget": "PROXIMITY ALARM, Impact Grenade", "primary_weapon": "UMP45, SUBMACHINE GUN, M1014, SHOTGUN", "secondary_weapon": "5.7 USG, HANDGUN, Super Shorty, SHOTGUN", "ability": "Armor Panel", "RealName": "Miles Campbell", "DateofBirth": "September 20th (Age 36)", "PlaceofBirth": "Sherman Oaks, California", "Biography": "Biography \u201cListen up, people: No one dies today.

Recruited into LAPD SWAT, Campbell excelled in tactical support and high-risk incidents. His careful application of dynamic and deliberate entries made him a Captain early on, while his exceptional perimeter control earned him his first commendation. Always interested in the safety of his team, Campbell worked tirelessly to perfect defense and reinforcement techniques and equipment. He has earned multiple commendations since his first and is a certified firearms specialist. Transferred to the FBI as a field agent where he trained with the German Federal Police (GSG-9), he was then recruited into the FBI SWAT team. Campbell has participated in cross-departmental training sessions with international law enforcement agencies, including the SAS and GIGN. Psychological report Within minutes of my first meeting with Specialist Campbell it was like being with an old friend. He has an easy-going manner. We joked over American football and our football \u2013 side note: look up the origins of the word \u201csoccer.\u201d I have 20 quid bet on it. [\u2026] Reports repeatedly mention that Campbell is referred to as \u201cpapa bear\u201d or \u201cthe diplomat\u201d among the Rainbow operators. He described how he smoothed over a heated discussion between two operators the other night. It\u2019s clear that he\u2019s the team\u2019s social glue. This, and his openness, means that Campbell can be grouped with any member of Rainbow. I\u2019m not surprised that he\u2019s the one with whom Specialist Eliza \u201cAsh\u201d Cohen feels the most comfortable. [\u2026] His sense of fair play is clear in both his personal and professional life. I wondered if it was ever a struggle for him, given what he\u2019s seen. Without hesitation he told me: His job is to protect those who can\u2019t protect themselves. Beyond the sense of justice that motivates him, he has a desire to transform things for the better. [\u2026] Our discussion explored his appreciation of his teammates, world cultures, and his love for the abused dogs he\u2019s rescued. Campbell\u2019s a curious person, someone who enjoys learning for learning\u2019s sake: Habitually staying up late to watch any sort of documentary certainly makes him a kindred spirit for me. He draws his positive energy from his parents, who have been married 42 years and are still madly in love. Along with inheriting their work ethic, it\u2019s their playfulness he tries to emulate. [\u2026] Campbell is a hopeful person. He believes in the potential of people \u2013 all people \u2013 and wants to be an agent of change. He\u2019s so concerned for others that he may overlook his own needs. I suspect this is what sparked his recent blow-up after a training exercise. His frustration with himself was evident. One of his strategies hadn\u2019t played out the way he had hoped.

His father was a pilot and his mother was a classified Senior Intelligence Officer. Estrada demonstrated acumen for science at an early age and was quickly moved into an advanced curriculum. His focus on Forensic Science and Biochemistry made him a perfect fit for the Biometrics Program with the FBI, which he joined as their youngest intern. He secured his role as an agent and was soon recruited into SWAT, working both in the field and in the FBI Lab. Estrada\u2019s high emotional intelligence led him to join the FBI\u2019s Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) where he excelled in crisis management and negotiation tactics. His knowledge of behavioral biometrics led to the creation of the Cardiac Sensor, along with several other prototypes which he continues to refine. Psychological report During operations, Specialist Jack \u201cPulse\u201d Estrada keeps his cool and consistently maintains sound judgment. So to meet someone with such boyish enthusiasm was an entertaining surprise for me. The conversation was a lively circuit of topics from biology, fighter jets, and scuba diving, to something his father builds in his spare time: Muscle cars. I honestly had never heard this term before. It completely baffled me. Estrada had to show me pictures. [\u2026] We discussed his childhood fascination with biology and chemistry. That he wanted to be an astronaut, and jokes that he still might be. He\u2019s fascinated with the concept of alien life-forms. Which, upon mentioning it, prompted him to describe his deep-sea diving expeditions with bouncing excitement. [\u2026] What does make Estrada quiet and contemplative is the mention of his mother. He becomes serious and there\u2019s a wistful tone in his voice. It was his mother who first noticed how good he was at deconstructing micro-expressions. She encouraged free-thinking and let him decide the pace of his academic studies. A naturally private person, her work in military intelligence made her even more so, but because Estrada can so easily read others I think it bothers him that he\u2019s unable to read his mother at all. [\u2026] Life is a sense of adventure and Estrada is ready to grasp it all. It\u2019s a healthy attitude and I wonder how his upbeat energy affects the group. Estrada told me that he\u2019s working on being more in the moment, \u201cslowing time.\u201d He\u2019s striving to be more mindful. I asked if anyone in particular had encouraged this new point of view, but he avoided the question. [\u2026] Even under the most extreme conditions, Estrada puts his team first; naturally they all speak highly of him. Estrada says it\u2019s the caliber of his teammates that makes him so dedicated. [\u2026] He and Specialist Jordan \u201cThermite\u201d Trace are close, but there is some professional rivalry between Estrada and Specialist Monika \u201cIQ\u201d Weiss.

He comes from a well-respected lineage in both the military and medicine. In his second year of medical studies with the prestigious Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes, Kateb answered the appeal for volunteers in M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF). He has subsequently volunteered numerous times on emergency frontline aid missions around the world. Upon graduation, Kateb declined a prominent private medical practice in favor of a career with the French Defense Health Service. Kateb\u2019s main discipline is toxicology and ecotoxicology. He has authored studies on biological agents and their effects on at-risk populations and damaged environments, and contributed reports to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Recognizing the ongoing need for doctors, Kateb continues to volunteer with MSF. He is a highly regarded medical officer for the commandement des forces sp\u00e9ciales Terre. Psychological report Specialist Gustave \u201cDoc\u201d Kateb\u2019s wealthy upbringing could easily have turned him into a narcissist, yet he\u2019s one of the most accessible and thoughtful people I\u2019ve encountered. Surprisingly, he didn\u2019t have much interest in being a doctor. The impetus seems to stem from family tradition, though it\u2019s clear his grandfather\u2019s military service was a strong motivation. Kateb admitted that he almost quit at the end of his first year because he didn\u2019t feel any passion for his work. I gather his father thought the mention of \u201cpassion\u201d was absurd. [\u2026] In his second year, Kateb volunteered for MSF and that first mission still resonates with him. The squalor, the chronic lack of supplies, the desperate need. He remembers how the look of worry on the mothers\u2019 faces subsided as they gathered near the tents. That was when he found his passion at last. [\u2026] Encountering people with so little, it\u2019s understandable that Kateb said he felt shame. What\u2019s interesting is that he described embarrassment as well for the life he still had. [\u2026] Field reports reflect Kateb\u2019s selfless acts, yet he has explicitly chosen a combat role. That piqued my interest. It was some time before he was willing to share his story with me. During a frontline op in East Africa, the hospital where Kateb worked was stormed by local militia. All of the patients he had fought so hard to save were killed. From this horrendous event he realized it was within his power to save lives with a scalpel or a bullet. [\u2026] Kateb\u2019s proclivity for conflict resolution is just one of a dozen skills that make him an asset to Rainbow. It\u2019s clear the team trusts and respects him. He\u2019s developed a strong bond with Specialist Emmanuelle \u201cTwitch\u201d Pichon, due in part to Pichon\u2019s use of technology to lessen the risk on human lives. Unfortunately, there is also unresolved animosity with Specialist Olivier \u201cLion\u201d Flament over quarantine procedures that saw several of Kateb\u2019s aid worker friends killed.

They both informed his sense of architectural design and precision, helping him earn top rankings in school. Along with Nizan\u2019s intellectual interests, he excelled in athletics from an early age, including Track & Field, fencing, and cycling. He later dropped out of university to cycle across France before returning and joining the Gendarmerie. Nizan thrived in his training, which included specialized qualifications in weapons, surveillance, and criminal investigations. His adaptability put him at the top of the list in military and defense courses, quickly catching the attention of the GIGN. His first operations with that unit combined all of the elements to satisfy his endless pursuit of challenges and adventure, according to staff psychologists. Specializing in hostage rescue and surveillance, Nizan\u2019s list of successful interventions is extensive. Psychological report In reviewing Specialist Julien \u201cRook\u201d Nizan\u2019s file, what stands out is his ability to adapt to demands. Very quickly into our conversation it was clear that Nizan\u2019s interests are wide-reaching. From his descriptions, it sounds like his parents imparted their eclectic tastes. Julien and his sister, \u00c9lodie, were especially encouraged to be curious about everything. I would argue that it\u2019s this openness to the world around him that led to the creation of his protective \u2013 yet still highly flexible \u2013 armor plating. [\u2026] Nizan\u2019s father is a stone mason, which requires imagination, precision, and dedication. His mother\u2019s ability to explore different vocations with verve \u2013 bookkeeping, street busker, florist, tour guide, sommelier, and chef \u2013 all strongly influenced how Nizan adapts to challenges and what goals he sets out for himself. [\u2026] The field reports reflect some of Nizan\u2019s chameleon-like way of merging into whatever role is required. This kind of versatility is rare \u2013 I\u2019ve asked leads such as Specialists Gustav \u201cDoc\u201d Kateb and Miles \u201cCastle\u201d Campbell to challenge Nizan more during operations. [\u2026] I\u2019m curious about how Nizan went from studying architecture to joining law enforcement. He grew up passionate about cycling, auto racing, and rock concerts, and he spent an inordinate amount of time trying to devise a scheme by which these could become careers. Ultimately, his interests evolved. Dropping out of university to cycle around France gave him his first sense of freedom. And then his world expanded further when he returned. At that time, the Gendarmerie enlisted his civilian father for an anti-corruption sting with local businesses. Nizan told me he was fascinated by the level of planning required by the police. [\u2026] Right from the beginning, Nizan remembers appreciating the broad spectrum of skills and range of expertise required to be in law enforcement and the military. Every day is different. [\u2026] Nizan is one of the more constant optimists on the team. His ability to energize other specialists is important, and he\u2019s certainly well liked. I\u2019d like to see Nizan\u2019s sense of adventure put to better use, however.

Proposals. These should be surprises. No one wants a grenade to the face.\u201d Raised by his uncle, a mechanic with the Bundespolizei (BPOL) Aviation Group, Streicher was around engines and motors at an early age. While he demonstrated skills in mechanics, it didn\u2019t hold the challenge that he was looking for. Since he had an affinity for complex machinery, his uncle encouraged him to study aeronautical engineering at university, but strict academic form was an uncomfortable fit for him. So while Streicher\u2019s grades were acceptable, he had a tendency toward restless antics. Following his hobby and passion in flying, he spent considerable time around pilots and aircraft. Private corporations sought him out, but Streicher joined BPOL-Aviation Group because it offered him unique challenges, the opportunity to fly and to serve his country. Almost immediately, Streicher began designing defensive weapon systems for BPOL including a ground-based Active Defense System (ADS) prototype. It was this prototype that caught the attention of GSG 9 and Rainbow. Psychological report Specialist Marius \u201cJ\u00e4ger\u201d Streicher has a creative curiosity that\u2019s reflected both in his operations and his daily life. The first part of our conversation was spent discussing a documentary that he watched the night before, about scientists searching for new antibiotics. Streicher was so caught up in it that he sent the link to Specialists Gustave \u201cDoc\u201d Kateb, Emmanuelle \u201cTwitch\u201d Pichon, and Lera \u201cFinka\u201d Melnikova. I\u2019m sure they were all equally interested, if maybe not thrilled to be contacted so early in the morning. That was only the start of our conversation. Streicher discussed other documentaries that he found fascinating: NASA sending a probe to the sun, new discoveries about Tyrannosaurus Rex, really anything to feed his voracious appetite for information on any subject. Robotics and artificial intelligence are the topics he seeks out the most but he enjoys almost anything. [\u2026] Streicher\u2019s lively energy made for a dizzying meeting. Though the conversation wasn\u2019t erratic, it had a path, I admit I wasn\u2019t able to see it until I noticed that he often mentions the team: Wondering if so-and-so is doing alright after the loss of their dog, if another one received the birthday card he sent, and other references. Streicher enjoys sharing information so that he can make connections. Not just his connection with individuals, but a web of connections among everyone. [\u2026] His own upbringing wasn\u2019t particularly lively or warm and the small family meant that he had very little company his age. He told me that his uncle was a fussy man \u2013 nitpicky. Streicher appreciates his uncle and all that he taught him, going so far as to say that his uncle made him a better person. But Streicher did also say that his uncle was closed off and had no sense of humor. I believe the translation is \u201cgrouchy bean counter.\u201d Understanding this background shines some light on why Streicher is so eager to create these connections with his team. He sees them as family. It certainly explains how intensely protective he is of them either on operations or during downtime. -- Dr. Harishva \u201cHarry\u201d Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}, "67": {"Side": "Defender", "Name": "bandit", "Squad": "Wolfguard", "Specialties": "NTRY,ANTI-GADGET", "HEALTH": 1, "Speed": 3, "Difficulty": 1, "Gadget": "Barbed Wire, Nitro Cell", "primary_weapon": "MP7, SUBMACHINE GUN, M870, SHOTGUN", "secondary_weapon": "P12, HANDGUN", "ability": "Shock Wire", "RealName": "Dominic Brunsmeier", "DateofBirth": "August 13th (Age 42)", "PlaceofBirth": "Berlin, Germany", "Biography": "Biography \u201cSurvival is all about timing. Nature doesn\u2019t give second chances.\u201d Brunsmeier and his twin brother were raised in a working class district near the Berlin Wall. Their father worked in the police force and strongly encouraged them to join. While working with Bundespolizei (BPOL) Brunsmeier excelled in crisis situations. He transferred to the Aviation Group long enough to obtain his helicopter license but his adaptability and experience with border surveillance flagged him for undercover operations. He was embedded as an undercover agent in the terrorist organization Red Army Faction (RAF), where his contribution was critical in seeing key members arrested and providing valuable information. While undercover, Brunsmeier honed skills in guerrilla tactics and improvised explosive devices. He developed prototypes of his electrified barricade and deployable shield. He is fluent in German, English, Polish and Turkish. Psychological report I wouldn\u2019t expect an operator who worked undercover for years amongst dangerous biker gangs and militants to be anything less than clever and adaptive. And in re-reading Specialist Dominic \u201cBandit\u201d Brunsmeier\u2019s file I\u2019m struck by just how resourceful he had to be. It\u2019s clear he had to be creative and strategic to stay alive. Frankly then, I was surprised by his sense of humor. It must\u2019ve sustained him through his undercover operations. That said, he can have a cold intensity. Nothing reminds me that I\u2019m a soft civilian more than looking into Brunsmeier\u2019s eyes. [\u2026] Brunsmeier certainly speaks fondly of his brother. He enjoys being an uncle to his brother\u2019s kids \u2013 how they\u2019re the only ones who let him be as silly as he\u2019d like. He told me about their childhood in the shadow of the Berlin Wall. How sometimes they\u2019d hear a BOOM from something triggering a land mine. And how they couldn\u2019t resist pranking the patrol guards with some twin antics. [\u2026] I didn\u2019t want to ask about the undercover work directly. It wasn\u2019t until our most recent meeting when he volunteered some information. Brunsmeier described the challenge of remembering the real \u201cyou\u201d when immersed in another persona. The question: \u201cWho are you?\u201d would creep into his sleep. If he dared to form an answer, he knew he was as good as dead. Even considering the question was dangerous. So he would push it away. We discussed details of what he had to do to ensure his cover wasn\u2019t blown, the source of some fantastic rumors circulating about him. Smiling, he assured me they\u2019re only half true. I don\u2019t want to break his confidence here. I merely need to assess if it has any lasting impact on him and the Rainbow team. [\u2026] The most I can offer at this time is that the team works well together. [\u2026] It\u2019s critical that Brunsmeier doesn\u2019t close himself off. Training scenarios alongside operators such as Specialists Miles \u201cCastle\u201d Campbell, Emmanuelle \u201cTwitch\u201d Pichon, or Elias \u201cBlitz\u201d K\u00f6tz could help. These operators have calming attributes that may temper Brunsmeier\u2019s inner demons. -- Dr. Harishva \u201cHarry\u201d Pandey, Director of Rainbow"}, "68": {"Side": "Defender", "Name": "tachanka", "Squad": "Redhammer", "Specialties": "NTRY,CROWD CONTROL", "HEALTH": 3, "Speed": 1, "Difficulty": 1, "Gadget": "Barbed Wire, PROXIMITY ALARM", "primary_weapon": "DP27, Light Machine Gun, 9x19VSN, SUBMACHINE GUN", "secondary_weapon": "PMM, HANDGUN, GSh-18, HANDGUN", "ability": "SHUMIKHA LAUNCHER", "Biography": ""}, "69": {"Side": "Defender", "Name": "kapkan", "Squad": "Redhammer", "Specialties": "NTRY,TRAPPER", "HEALTH": 2, "Speed": 2, "Difficulty": 1, "Gadget": "Impact Grenade, Nitro Cell", "primary_weapon": "9x19VSN, SUBMACHINE GUN, SASG-12, SHOTGUN", "secondary_weapon": "PMM, HANDGUN, GSh-18, HANDGUN", "ability": "Entry Denial Device", "Biography": ""}}}
